After merging PR to master-branch, [Version-action](./.github/workflows/version.yml) will update special PR with the next release. To publish this release, just merge special PR and wait, [Release-action](./.github/workflows/release.yml) will publish packages.

#### New package creation

Copy-paste `packages/atomic-router` directory, rename it to the package name. Then, update `package.json`, `README.md` and `vite.config.ts` files. Then, delete `CHANGELOG.md` file and any other files that are not needed in the new package.

Fancy generator will be added in the future.
