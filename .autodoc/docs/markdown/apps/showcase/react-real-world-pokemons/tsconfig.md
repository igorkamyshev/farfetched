The code provided is a configuration file written in JSON format. It is used to configure the TypeScript compiler for the farfetched project. The configuration file is named `tsconfig.json` and is located in the `farfetched` directory.

The purpose of this code is to specify the compiler options and settings for the TypeScript compiler. These options define how the TypeScript code will be compiled into JavaScript. Let's go through the different sections of the code to understand its purpose:

1. `"extends": "../../../tsconfig.base.json"`: This line specifies that the configuration should extend the settings defined in the `tsconfig.base.json` file located two directories above the current directory. This allows for reusing common settings across multiple projects.

2. `"compilerOptions": { ... }`: This section contains various options that configure the behavior of the TypeScript compiler. Some notable options include:
   - `"target": "ESNext"`: Specifies that the output JavaScript should be compatible with the ECMAScript version ESNext, which represents the latest version of JavaScript.
   - `"module": "ESNext"`: Specifies that the module system used in the project is ESNext, which supports modern JavaScript module syntax.
   - `"strict": true`: Enables strict type-checking and additional type inference rules to catch common errors.
   - `"resolveJsonModule": true`: Allows importing JSON files as modules in TypeScript.
   - `"lib": ["DOM", "DOM.Iterable", "ESNext"]`: Specifies the libraries that are available to the project. In this case, it includes the DOM and DOM.Iterable libraries, which provide typings for working with the Document Object Model, and the ESNext library for modern JavaScript features.

3. `"include": ["**/*.js", "**/*.jsx", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", "src"]`: This line specifies the files and directories that should be included in the compilation process. It includes all JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSX files in the project's source directory (`src`).

By providing this configuration file, developers working on the farfetched project can ensure that their TypeScript code is compiled with the desired settings and options. This allows for better type-checking, compatibility with modern JavaScript features, and a more efficient development process.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `extends` property in the `tsconfig.json` file?**
The `extends` property is used to inherit compiler options from another configuration file. In this case, the `tsconfig.base.json` file is being extended.

2. **What is the significance of the `"target": "ESNext"` compiler option?**
The `"target": "ESNext"` option specifies that the code should be compiled to ECMAScript version Next, which includes the latest JavaScript features and syntax.

3. **Why is the `"noEmit": true` option set?**
The `"noEmit": true` option prevents the TypeScript compiler from generating any output files. This is useful when the code is being transpiled by another tool or build process.
