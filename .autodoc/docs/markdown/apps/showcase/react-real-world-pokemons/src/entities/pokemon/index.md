The code provided is exporting two modules, `Pokemon` and `Species`, from the `contract` file, and two modules, `pokemonUrl` and `speciesUrl`, from the `api` file. 

The purpose of this code is to make these modules available for use in other parts of the project. By exporting these modules, they can be imported and used in other files within the project.

The `Pokemon` and `Species` modules are likely related to the data structure and functionality of Pokemon and species information. These modules may contain classes, functions, or variables that define the properties and behavior of Pokemon and species objects. For example, the `Pokemon` module may define a `Pokemon` class with methods for retrieving and manipulating Pokemon data, while the `Species` module may define a `Species` class with methods for retrieving and manipulating species data.

The `pokemonUrl` and `speciesUrl` modules are likely related to the URLs or endpoints used to fetch Pokemon and species data from an external API. These modules may contain variables or functions that define the URLs or endpoints for retrieving Pokemon and species data. For example, the `pokemonUrl` module may define a `pokemonUrl` variable that stores the URL for fetching Pokemon data, while the `speciesUrl` module may define a `speciesUrl` variable that stores the URL for fetching species data.

By exporting these modules, other parts of the project can import and use them as needed. For example, a file that needs to work with Pokemon data can import the `Pokemon` module and use its methods to retrieve and manipulate Pokemon data. Similarly, a file that needs to fetch species data can import the `speciesUrl` module and use its variables to construct the appropriate API request.

Overall, this code plays a crucial role in making the `Pokemon`, `Species`, `pokemonUrl`, and `speciesUrl` modules available for use throughout the larger project. It allows other files to import and utilize these modules to work with Pokemon and species data and interact with the external API.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `contract` file?**
The `contract` file likely contains the definitions and interfaces for the `Pokemon` and `Species` classes, but it would be helpful to confirm this assumption.

2. **What functionality does the `api` file provide?**
The `api` file likely contains functions or methods related to making API requests, but it would be beneficial to know the specific functionality it provides.

3. **How are the exported variables used in the project?**
It would be useful to understand how the exported variables `Pokemon`, `Species`, `pokemonUrl`, and `speciesUrl` are used within the project and how they relate to each other.
