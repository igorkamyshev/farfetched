The code provided is a part of the "farfetched" project and it serves the purpose of fetching and managing a list of Pokémon data from an API. 

The code imports various functions and modules from different libraries and files to achieve its goal. It imports functions like `createJsonQuery` and `declareParams` from the `@farfetched/core` library, `runtypeContract` from the `@farfetched/runtypes` library, and modules like `Array`, `Number`, and `Record` from the `runtypes` library. It also imports functions like `createGate`, `combine`, `createStore`, `sample`, and `createJsonQuery` from the `effector` library. Additionally, it imports the `pokemonUrl` function from the `../../entities/pokemon` file and the `urlToId` function from the `../../shared/id` file. Lastly, it imports the `EntityLink` component from the `../../shared/entity_link` file.

The code defines a gate called `MainPageGate` which takes an object with a `page` property as its parameter. It also creates a store called `$perPage` with an initial value of 20.

The code then defines a `pokemonListQuery` using the `createJsonQuery` function. This query specifies the parameters, request details, and response handling for fetching the Pokémon data. The request is a GET request to the `pokemonUrl()` with a query parameter called `source` which is a combination of the `limit` value from the `$perPage` store. The response is expected to be a JSON object with a `count` property of type `Number` and a `results` property of type `Array(EntityLink)`. The `mapData` function is used to transform the response data by adding an `id` property to each result object using the `urlToId` function.

The code then defines two derived stores: `$pokemonList` and `$totalPages`. `$pokemonList` maps the `results` property from the `pokemonListQuery.$data` store, returning an empty array if the response is null. `$totalPages` calculates the total number of pages based on the `count` property from the `pokemonListQuery.$data` store and the `perPage` value from the `$perPage` store.

Lastly, the code sets up a sample using the `sample` function. This sample triggers the `pokemonListQuery.start` event whenever the `MainPageGate.state` changes.

Overall, this code sets up a query to fetch Pokémon data, transforms the response, and provides derived stores for the list of Pokémon, the total number of pages, and the pending state of the query. It also sets up a gate and a sample to trigger the query based on the gate's state. This code can be used in the larger project to fetch and manage Pokémon data for display and interaction.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MainPageGate` and how is it used in this code?
- The `MainPageGate` is created using `createGate()` and it takes an object with a `page` property. It is used as a signal to trigger the `pokemonListQuery` when its state changes.

2. What is the purpose of the `$perPage` store and how is it used in this code?
- The `$perPage` store is created using `createStore()` and it holds the value `20`. It is used as the `limit` parameter in the `pokemonListQuery` request.

3. What is the purpose of the `sample()` function at the end of the code and what does it do?
- The `sample()` function is used to create a sample event that triggers the `pokemonListQuery.start` when the `MainPageGate.state` changes. This ensures that the query is executed when the `page` value in `MainPageGate` changes.
