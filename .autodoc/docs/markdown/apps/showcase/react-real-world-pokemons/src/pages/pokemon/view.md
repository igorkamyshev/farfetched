The code provided is a React component called `PokemonPage` that is part of the larger `farfetched` project. This component is responsible for rendering the details of a specific Pokemon on a web page.

The component imports two functions, `useGate` and `useUnit`, from the `effector-react` library, as well as the `useParams` hook from the `react-router-dom` library. It also imports three variables, `$pending`, `$pokemon`, and `PokemonPageGate`, from a file located in the same directory.

The `useParams` hook is used to extract the `id` parameter from the URL. This `id` is then passed as an argument to the `PokemonPageGate` gate using the `useGate` function. The `PokemonPageGate` gate is responsible for fetching the details of the Pokemon with the given `id` and updating the corresponding stores.

The `useUnit` function is used to subscribe to the `$pending` and `$pokemon` stores and retrieve their current values. The values are then destructured into the `pending` and `pokemon` variables.

If the `pending` variable is true, a loading message is rendered. Otherwise, the details of the Pokemon are rendered using JSX. The Pokemon's name is displayed as a heading, its avatar is displayed as an image, and its height, weight, and color (if available) are displayed in a table.

Overall, this code is responsible for fetching and displaying the details of a specific Pokemon on a web page. It utilizes the `useParams` hook to extract the `id` parameter from the URL, the `useGate` function to trigger the fetching of the Pokemon's details, and the `useUnit` function to subscribe to the relevant stores and retrieve the data. This component can be used in the larger `farfetched` project to create a dynamic Pokemon details page.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `useGate` function and how is it used in this code?**
The `useGate` function is used to activate a gate from the Effector library. In this code, it is used to activate the `PokemonPageGate` gate with the `id` parameter extracted from the URL.

2. **What is the purpose of the `useUnit` function and how is it used in this code?**
The `useUnit` function is used to subscribe to multiple stores from the Effector library and get their current values. In this code, it is used to subscribe to the `$pending` and `$pokemon` stores and retrieve their current values as `pending` and `pokemon` respectively.

3. **What does the conditional rendering in the code do?**
The conditional rendering checks if the `pending` variable is true. If it is true, it renders a loading message. Otherwise, it renders the details of the `pokemon` object, such as its name, avatar, height, weight, and color (if available).
