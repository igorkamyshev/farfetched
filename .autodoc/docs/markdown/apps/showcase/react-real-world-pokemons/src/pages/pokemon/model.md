The code provided is a part of the "farfetched" project and is responsible for fetching and managing data related to a specific Pokemon. 

The code imports various functions and modules from external libraries and files. These imports include functions like `connectQuery`, `createJsonQuery`, `declareParams`, `runtypeContract`, `createGate`, `combine`, and `sample`. It also imports types and URLs related to Pokemon and Species entities.

The code defines a gate called `PokemonPageGate` using the `createGate` function. This gate is used to control the flow of data and trigger actions related to the Pokemon page.

Two queries are defined using the `createJsonQuery` function. The `pokemonQuery` is responsible for fetching data about a specific Pokemon, while the `speciesQuery` is responsible for fetching data about the species of that Pokemon. These queries are configured with request methods, URLs, and response contracts.

The `$pending` variable is exported, which represents the pending state of the `pokemonQuery`. The `$pokemon` variable is defined using the `combine` function, which combines the data from `pokemonQuery.$data` and `speciesQuery.$data` into a single object. The `combine` function also maps the data to include the Pokemon's color from the species data.

A `sample` function is used to trigger the `pokemonQuery` when the `PokemonPageGate` state changes. It filters the parameters to ensure that the `id` is present and then passes it to the `pokemonQuery.start` function.

The `connectQuery` function is used to connect the `pokemonQuery` and `speciesQuery`. It maps the result of the `pokemonQuery` to extract the species URL and passes it as a parameter to the `speciesQuery`.

Overall, this code sets up the necessary queries and connections to fetch and manage data related to a specific Pokemon. It provides a way to control the flow of data using the `PokemonPageGate` gate and combines the data from the queries into a single object for further use in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `PokemonPageGate` constant?**
The `PokemonPageGate` constant is used to create a gate in the `effector-react` library, which allows for managing the state and triggering effects related to the Pokemon page.

2. **What is the purpose of the `$pending` constant?**
The `$pending` constant is used to track the pending status of the `pokemonQuery` request. It is likely used to display loading indicators or handle UI states related to the request.

3. **What is the purpose of the `sample` function?**
The `sample` function is used to create a sample event that triggers the `pokemonQuery.start` effect when the `PokemonPageGate.state` changes and the `params.id` is truthy. It is likely used to fetch the Pokemon data when the page is loaded or when the `id` parameter changes.
