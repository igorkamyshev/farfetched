The `app.tsx` file is responsible for setting up the routing functionality of the farfetched project using the react-router-dom library. It imports the necessary components from the library and defines the routes for the application. Each route is represented by an object with properties such as `path` and `element`. The `path` property specifies the URL path for the route, and the `element` property specifies the component to render when that route is accessed. For example, the root route `'/'` is defined with an `element` that consists of the `Menu` component and the `Outlet` component. The `Menu` component renders the navigation menu, while the `Outlet` component is a placeholder for the content that will be rendered based on the current route. The `createBrowserRouter` function returns a `router` object, which is passed as a prop to the `RouterProvider` component. The `RouterProvider` component provides the routing functionality to the rest of the application.

```jsx
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Menu } from 'features/layout';
import { MainPage, PokemonPage } from 'pages';

const routes = [
  { path: '/', element: <Menu /> },
  { path: 'pokemons/:page', element: <MainPage /> },
  { path: 'pokemon/:id', element: <PokemonPage /> },
];

const router = createBrowserRouter(routes);

function App() {
  return (
    <RouterProvider router={router}>
      <Outlet />
    </RouterProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

The `main.tsx` file is the entry point for the React application. It imports the `createRoot` function from the `react-dom/client` module and the `App` component from the `app.js` file. The `createRoot` function creates a root component that will be rendered into the DOM. The `App` component is rendered inside the root component created by the `createRoot` function. The `render` method is called on the root component to render the `App` component into the DOM.

```jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './app';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

The `pages` subfolder is expected to contain the components that are rendered based on the current route. However, no files or subfolders are provided for this directory.
