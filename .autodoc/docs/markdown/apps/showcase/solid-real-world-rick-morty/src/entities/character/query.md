The code provided is a part of the farfetched project and it defines three functions: `characterQuery`, `characterListQuery`, and `characterPageQuery`. These functions are used to create JSON queries for retrieving character data from an API.

The `createJsonQuery` function is imported from the `@farfetched/core` module. It is a utility function that takes an object as an argument and returns a JSON query object. The object passed to `createJsonQuery` contains three properties: `params`, `request`, and `response`.

The `params` property is defined using the `declareParams` function from the `@farfetched/core` module. It is used to declare the parameters that will be passed to the query. In this code, the `params` property is an object with a single property `id` of type `TId` for the `characterQuery` function, `ids` of type `TId[]` for the `characterListQuery` function, and `page` of type `number` for the `characterPageQuery` function.

The `request` property is an object that defines the URL, method, and query parameters for the API request. The URL is generated using the `characterUrl` function from the `./api` module. The method is set to 'GET' for all three functions. The `query` property is only used in the `characterPageQuery` function and it generates the query parameters for the API request based on the `page` parameter.

The `response` property is an object that defines the contract for the API response. It uses the `runtypeContract` function from the `@farfetched/runtypes` module to define the contract. The contract specifies the expected structure of the response data. For the `characterQuery` function, the response is expected to be of type `Character`. For the `characterListQuery` function, the response is expected to be an array of `Character`. For the `characterPageQuery` function, the response is expected to be an object with properties `info` of type `Info` and `results` which is an array of `Character`.

These functions can be used in the larger project to make API requests for character data. The `characterQuery` function can be used to retrieve data for a single character by providing the `id` parameter. The `characterListQuery` function can be used to retrieve data for multiple characters by providing an array of `ids`. The `characterPageQuery` function can be used to retrieve data for a specific page of characters by providing the `page` parameter.

Example usage:

```javascript
const characterData = await characterQuery({ id: 1 });
console.log(characterData);

const characterListData = await characterListQuery({ ids: [1, 2, 3] });
console.log(characterListData);

const characterPageData = await characterPageQuery({ page: 1 });
console.log(characterPageData);
```

In the above example, the `characterQuery` function is used to retrieve data for a character with `id` 1. The `characterListQuery` function is used to retrieve data for characters with `ids` 1, 2, and 3. The `characterPageQuery` function is used to retrieve data for the first page of characters. The retrieved data is then logged to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `createJsonQuery` function?**
The `createJsonQuery` function is used to create a JSON query object that defines the parameters, request details, and response contract for making API requests.

2. **What is the purpose of the `declareParams` function?**
The `declareParams` function is used to declare the types and structure of the parameters that can be passed to the API requests. It ensures that the parameters are of the correct type and structure.

3. **What is the purpose of the `runtypeContract` function?**
The `runtypeContract` function is used to define the contract or schema for the response data. It specifies the expected structure and types of the response data, allowing for validation and type checking.
