The code provided is part of the `farfetched` project and is responsible for handling queries related to episodes and characters. 

The code begins by importing necessary functions and objects from various modules. It imports `attachOperation` and `connectQuery` from the `@farfetched/core` module, and `sample` from the `effector` module. It also imports `characterListQuery` and `episodeQuery` from the `character` and `episode` entities respectively. Additionally, it imports `episodeRoute` from the `episode` entity and `urlToId` and `TUrl` from the `shared` module.

The code then defines two query functions: `curentEpisodeQuery` and `charactersInEpisodeQuery`. The `curentEpisodeQuery` is created by attaching the `episodeQuery` operation. The `charactersInEpisodeQuery` is created by attaching the `characterListQuery` operation and providing a `mapParams` function that maps an array of URLs to an object with an `ids` property containing the mapped IDs.

Next, the `connectQuery` function is called. This function connects the `curentEpisodeQuery` as the source and the `charactersInEpisodeQuery` as the target. It also provides a callback function that receives the result of the `curentEpisodeQuery` and returns an object with a `params` property containing the characters of the episode. This allows the `charactersInEpisodeQuery` to be executed with the appropriate parameters.

After that, the `sample` function is called. It takes the `episodeRoute.opened` event as the clock and provides a callback function that receives the `params` object from the event and returns an object with an `id` property containing the episode ID. The `curentEpisodeQuery.start` function is set as the target, which starts the query with the provided parameters.

Finally, the `episodeRoute`, `curentEpisodeQuery`, and `charactersInEpisodeQuery` are exported for use in other parts of the project.

In summary, this code sets up and connects queries related to episodes and characters. It allows for retrieving the current episode and the characters in that episode based on the provided URLs and parameters. This code is likely used in the larger project to fetch and display episode and character data to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `attachOperation` function?**
The `attachOperation` function is used to attach a query or operation to a source and define any necessary mapping or transformation of parameters.

2. **What is the purpose of the `connectQuery` function?**
The `connectQuery` function is used to connect the source query to the target query, and define a function to transform the result of the source query before passing it to the target query.

3. **What is the purpose of the `sample` function?**
The `sample` function is used to create a sample event that triggers a given function when the specified clock event occurs, and passes the clock event parameters to the function. In this code, it is used to trigger the `curentEpisodeQuery.start` function when the `episodeRoute.opened` event occurs.
