The code provided is part of the farfetched project and is responsible for handling queries related to characters, locations, and episodes. It imports various functions and objects from different modules and uses them to create and connect queries.

The code begins by importing the `attachOperation` and `connectQuery` functions from the `@farfetched/core` module, as well as the `sample` function from the `effector` module. These functions are used to create and manage queries.

Next, the code imports specific queries from the `character`, `episode`, and `location` modules, as well as the `urlToId` function from the `shared/id` module and the `TUrl` type from the `shared/url` module.

The code then creates several query objects using the `attachOperation` function. The `currentCharacterQuery` is created using the `characterQuery` function. The `currentLocationQuery` and `originQuery` are both created using the `locationQuery` function, with the `mapParams` option provided to map the URL parameter to the required format. The `characterEpisodesQuery` is created using the `episodeListQuery` function, with the `mapParams` option provided to map the array of URLs to an array of IDs.

After creating the queries, the code uses the `connectQuery` function to connect the `characterQuery` to the `originQuery`, `currentLocationQuery`, and `characterEpisodesQuery`. This is done by specifying the source query, a function that extracts the necessary parameters from the source query result, and the target query.

Finally, the code uses the `sample` function to create a sample that triggers the `currentCharacterQuery` when the `characterRoute.opened` event occurs. The `fn` option is used to extract the `characterId` parameter from the event and pass it to the `currentCharacterQuery`.

The code exports the created queries for use in other parts of the project.

In summary, this code sets up and connects queries related to characters, locations, and episodes in the farfetched project. It uses the `attachOperation` and `connectQuery` functions to create and manage the queries, and the `sample` function to trigger the `currentCharacterQuery` based on a specific event. The exported queries can be used in other parts of the project to fetch and manipulate data.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `attachOperation` function and how is it used in this code?**
The `attachOperation` function is used to attach a query operation to a specific query function. It is used in this code to attach operations to the `characterQuery`, `locationQuery`, and `episodeListQuery` functions.

2. **What is the purpose of the `connectQuery` function and how is it used in this code?**
The `connectQuery` function is used to connect a source query to a target query, with a transformation function applied to the source query result. It is used in this code to connect the `characterQuery` to the `originQuery`, `currentLocationQuery`, and `characterEpisodesQuery` queries.

3. **What is the purpose of the `sample` function and how is it used in this code?**
The `sample` function is used to create a sample event that triggers a target query when a specific clock event occurs. It is used in this code to trigger the `currentCharacterQuery` when the `characterRoute.opened` clock event occurs.
