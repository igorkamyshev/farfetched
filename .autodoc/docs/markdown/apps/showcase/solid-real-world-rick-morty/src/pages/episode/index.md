The code provided is a module export statement that exports the `EpisodePage` component from the `view` file. This code is part of the larger farfetched project and is used to organize and manage the components and views within the project.

The `EpisodePage` component is likely a React component that represents a page or view for displaying information about a specific episode. It may contain various UI elements and logic for fetching and rendering episode data.

By exporting the `EpisodePage` component, other files within the farfetched project can import and use this component. This allows for code reusability and modularity, as the `EpisodePage` component can be easily imported and integrated into other parts of the project.

For example, in another file within the farfetched project, the `EpisodePage` component can be imported and used like this:

```javascript
import { EpisodePage } from 'farfetched';

// Use the EpisodePage component
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Farfetched App</h1>
      <EpisodePage />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `EpisodePage` component is imported from the `farfetched` module and rendered within the `App` component. This allows the `EpisodePage` component to be displayed as part of the larger application.

Overall, this code is a simple module export statement that exports the `EpisodePage` component from the `view` file. It is used to make the `EpisodePage` component accessible and reusable within the farfetched project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `EpisodePage` component?**
The `EpisodePage` component is exported from the `view` file, but it is not clear what functionality or UI it provides within the project.

2. **Are there any other components or functions being exported from the `view` file?**
The code only shows the export of the `EpisodePage` component, but it is possible that there are other exports from the `view` file that are not shown.

3. **Where is the `view` file located within the project directory structure?**
The code only provides the relative path `./view`, but it does not specify the exact location of the `view` file within the `farfetched` project.
