The code provided is a React component called `Pagination` that is used to render a pagination component in a larger project. The purpose of this component is to display a set of page numbers and navigation links (previous and next) based on the current page and the total number of pages.

The `Pagination` component takes in three props: `currentPage`, `info`, and `route`. 
- `currentPage` is the current page number.
- `info` is an object that contains information about the pagination, such as the total number of pages (`info.pages`), the previous page URL (`info.prev`), and the next page URL (`info.next`).
- `route` is an instance of the `RouteInstance` class, which represents the current route.

The component uses the `Show` and `For` components from the `solid-js` library to conditionally render the pagination links and page numbers. 

The `toParams` function is a helper function that takes a page number as input and returns an object with the page number as a parameter. If the page number is 1, an empty object is returned. This function is used to generate the `params` prop for the `Link` components.

The `hasNext`, `hasPrevious`, and `totalPages` functions are helper functions that check if there is a next page, a previous page, and return the total number of pages, respectively. These functions are used to conditionally render the previous and next navigation links.

The `allInRange` function is another helper function that takes a range of numbers (from and to) and returns an array of numbers within that range. This function is used in the `For` component to iterate over the page numbers and render the corresponding `Link` components.

Here is an example usage of the `Pagination` component:

```jsx
import { Pagination } from 'farfetched';

function App() {
  const currentPage = 3;
  const info = {
    pages: 5,
    prev: '/page/2',
    next: '/page/4',
  };
  const route = new RouteInstance({ page: currentPage });

  return (
    <Pagination currentPage={currentPage} info={info} route={route} />
  );
}
```

In this example, the `Pagination` component is rendered with the current page set to 3, the total number of pages set to 5, and the previous and next page URLs set accordingly. The `route` prop is created using the `RouteInstance` class with the current page as a parameter. The component will render the pagination links and page numbers based on these props.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `Pagination` component?**
The `Pagination` component is responsible for rendering pagination links based on the current page, information about the total number of pages, and the route instance.

2. **What does the `toParams` function do?**
The `toParams` function takes a page number as input and returns an object with a `page` property if the page number is not equal to 1, otherwise it returns an empty object.

3. **What is the purpose of the `allInRange` function?**
The `allInRange` function generates an array of numbers starting from the `from` value and ending at the `to` value, inclusive. This array is used to render the pagination links.
