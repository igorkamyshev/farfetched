This code is a configuration file for the farfetched project, specifically for the "showcase-solid-real-world-rick-morty" application within the project. The purpose of this code is to define the build, serve, lint, and preview targets for the application.

The "build" target is responsible for building the application using the "@nrwl/vite:build" executor. It specifies the output path for the built application as "dist/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty".

The "serve" target uses the "@nrwl/vite:dev-server" executor to start a development server for the application. It depends on the "build" target to ensure that the application is built before serving it.

The "lint" target utilizes the "@nrwl/linter:eslint" executor to run linting on the application's source code. It specifies the lint file patterns to include all TypeScript and JavaScript files within the "apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty" directory.

The "preview" target is responsible for starting a preview server for the application. It uses the "@nrwl/vite:preview-server" executor and has two configurations: "development" and "production". The "development" configuration uses the "build" target with the "development" configuration, while the "production" configuration uses the "build" target with the "production" configuration.

Overall, this code provides the necessary configuration for building, serving, linting, and previewing the "showcase-solid-real-world-rick-morty" application within the farfetched project. It ensures that the application is built correctly, provides a development server for testing, performs linting to maintain code quality, and allows for previewing the application in both development and production environments.
