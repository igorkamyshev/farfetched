The `react-real-world-pokemons` folder contains the main configuration files and source code for the `farfetched` project, a web application built with React and TypeScript.

The `index.html` file serves as the entry point for the web application. It includes a `div` with the id `root`, which is a placeholder for the root component of the React application. The `script` tag imports and executes a JavaScript module located at "/src/main.tsx", which is responsible for rendering the application and handling user interactions.

The `project.json` file defines various targets and options for building, serving, linting, and previewing the project. For instance, to build the project, you would run `nx run showcase-react-real-world-pokemons:build`.

The `tsconfig.json` file specifies the compiler options and settings for TypeScript, such as the target ECMAScript version, the module system, and the libraries available to the project.

The `vite.config.ts` file configures the Vite build tool, specifying the cache directory, the output directory, and the plugins to be used during the build process.

The `src` subfolder contains the source code for the application. The `app.tsx` file sets up the routing functionality using the react-router-dom library. The `main.tsx` file is the entry point for the React application, which renders the `App` component into the DOM.

Here's an example of how the routing functionality might be used:

```jsx
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Menu } from 'features/layout';
import { MainPage, PokemonPage } from 'pages';

const routes = [
  { path: '/', element: <Menu /> },
  { path: 'pokemons/:page', element: <MainPage /> },
  { path: 'pokemon/:id', element: <PokemonPage /> },
];

const router = createBrowserRouter(routes);

function App() {
  return (
    <RouterProvider router={router}>
      <Outlet />
    </RouterProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `App` component uses the `RouterProvider` component to provide routing functionality to the rest of the application. The `Outlet` component is a placeholder for the content that will be rendered based on the current route. The routes are defined as an array of objects, each representing a route with a `path` and an `element`. The `path` is the URL path for the route, and the `element` is the component to render when that route is accessed.
