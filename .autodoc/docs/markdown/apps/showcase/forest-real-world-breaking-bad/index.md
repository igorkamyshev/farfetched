The code provided is an HTML file that serves as the entry point for a web application. It is likely a part of the larger Farfetched project, which is a web application that may involve the use of React or a similar JavaScript framework.

The purpose of this code is to define the structure and initial content of the web page. It includes the necessary HTML tags and attributes to create a basic webpage layout. Let's break down the code:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This is the document type declaration, which specifies that the document is an HTML5 document.
- `<html lang="en">`: This tag represents the root element of an HTML page and specifies the language of the document.
- `<head>`: This section contains meta-information about the document, such as the character encoding, title, and viewport settings.
- `<meta charset="utf-8" />`: This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the document.
- `<title>Breaking Bad and Farfetched</title>`: This tag sets the title of the webpage, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<base href="/" />`: This tag specifies the base URL for all relative URLs within the document.
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />`: This meta tag sets the viewport properties, which control how the webpage is displayed on different devices.
- `<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico" />`: This link tag specifies the favicon, which is the small icon displayed in the browser's tab or bookmark bar.

The body of the HTML document contains the main content of the webpage. In this case, it includes a single div element with the id "root". This div is likely the mount point for the React or JavaScript application.

Finally, the code includes a script tag that references a JavaScript file located at "/src/main.tsx". This file is likely the entry point for the JavaScript application and may contain the logic and components that make up the Farfetched web application.

Overall, this code sets up the basic structure and initial content of the webpage, and it includes a reference to the main JavaScript file that powers the Farfetched application.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `base` tag?**
The `base` tag is used to specify the base URL for all relative URLs in the document. It helps in resolving relative URLs correctly.

2. **What is the purpose of the `viewport` meta tag?**
The `viewport` meta tag is used to control the layout and scaling of the webpage on different devices. It ensures that the webpage is displayed correctly on various screen sizes.

3. **What is the purpose of the `type="module"` attribute in the script tag?**
The `type="module"` attribute indicates that the script is a JavaScript module. It allows the use of modern JavaScript features and enables the use of `import` and `export` statements for module dependencies.
