The code provided is a function called `extractNumber` that takes in an event object `e` as a parameter. The purpose of this function is to extract a number value from the event object and return it. 

The function first retrieves the value from the event object using the `valueAsNumber` property. This property is used to get the numeric value of an input element, such as a text field or a range input. 

Next, the function checks if the extracted value is NaN (Not a Number) using the `Number.isNaN()` method. If the value is indeed NaN, it means that the extracted value is not a valid number. In this case, the function returns a default value of 1.

If the extracted value is a valid number, it is returned as is.

This function can be used in various scenarios where a number value needs to be extracted from an event object. For example, it can be used in a form validation process where the user is expected to enter a numeric value in an input field. By calling this function and passing the event object as an argument, the extracted number can be used for further processing or validation.

Here's an example usage of the `extractNumber` function:

```javascript
const inputElement = document.getElementById('myInput');
inputElement.addEventListener('input', (event) => {
  const extractedNumber = extractNumber(event);
  console.log(extractedNumber);
});
```

In this example, an input element with the id "myInput" is selected from the DOM. An event listener is added to the input element, listening for the 'input' event. When the user types into the input field, the event object is passed to the `extractNumber` function, and the extracted number is logged to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `extractNumber` function?**
The `extractNumber` function is used to extract a number value from an event object.

2. **What does the `e` parameter represent in the `extractNumber` function?**
The `e` parameter represents the event object that is passed to the function.

3. **What does the function return if the extracted value is not a number?**
If the extracted value is not a number, the function returns the value 1.
