The `dom.ts` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/apps/showcase/forest-real-world-breaking-bad/src/shared` directory contains a utility function named `extractNumber`. This function is designed to extract a numeric value from an event object, which is typically generated when a user interacts with an HTML input element.

The function accepts an event object `e` as a parameter. It then attempts to retrieve a numeric value from the event object using the `valueAsNumber` property. This property is commonly used to obtain the numeric value of an input element, such as a text field or a range input.

The function then checks if the extracted value is NaN (Not a Number) using the `Number.isNaN()` method. If the value is NaN, it implies that the extracted value is not a valid number. In such a case, the function returns a default value of 1.

If the extracted value is a valid number, it is returned as is.

This function can be utilized in various scenarios where a numeric value needs to be extracted from an event object. For instance, it can be used in a form validation process where the user is expected to enter a numeric value in an input field.

Here's an example of how the `extractNumber` function can be used:

```javascript
const inputElement = document.getElementById('myInput');
inputElement.addEventListener('input', (event) => {
  const extractedNumber = extractNumber(event);
  console.log(extractedNumber);
});
```

In this example, an input element with the id "myInput" is selected from the DOM. An event listener is added to the input element, listening for the 'input' event. When the user types into the input field, the event object is passed to the `extractNumber` function, and the extracted number is logged to the console. This function can be a valuable utility in the larger project, especially in scenarios where user input needs to be validated or processed.
