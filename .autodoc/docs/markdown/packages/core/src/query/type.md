The code provided is part of a project called "farfetched" and contains the implementation of a Query object. This Query object is used to fetch and manage data from a remote server.

The code begins by importing necessary dependencies from external modules. It imports the `Store` and `Event` types from the 'effector' module, as well as the `ExecutionMeta` and `RemoteOperation` types from the '../remote_operation/type' module. It also imports the `Serialize` type from the '../libs/patronus' module.

Next, the code defines a constant `QuerySymbol` which is a Symbol used to identify the Query object. This symbol is later used in the `isQuery` function to check if a given value is an instance of the Query object.

The code then defines an interface `QueryMeta` which represents metadata associated with a Query object. It has three properties:
- `serialize`: A function used to serialize the data in various cases, such as transferring state from server to client during server-side rendering or saving state to persistent storage during caching.
- `initialData`: The initial data for the Query object.
- `sid`: A string or null representing the session ID associated with the Query object.

Next, the code defines an interface `QueryExtraLowLevelAPI` which represents additional low-level API methods for the Query object. It has one property:
- `refreshSkipDueToFreshness`: An event that can be triggered to skip refreshing the data if it is already fresh.

The code then defines the main `Query` interface which extends the `RemoteOperation` interface. It represents a Query object and has the following properties and methods:
- `refresh`: An event that can be triggered to start fetching data if it is absent or stale.
- `$data`: A store that holds the latest received data. If there was an error during fetching or there has not been a request yet, the store will be `null`.
- `$error`: A store that holds the data retrieval error. If the data was successfully fetched or there is no request yet, the store will be `null`.
- `$stale`: A store that indicates whether the data is stale.
- `aborted`: An event that can be triggered to abort a query execution.
- `reset`: An event that can be triggered to reset the whole state of the query.

The code also defines a type `QueryInitialData` which extracts the initial data type from a given Query object.

Finally, the code provides a function `isQuery` which checks if a given value is an instance of the Query object. It does this by checking if the value has a `kind` property equal to the `QuerySymbol`.

Overall, this code provides the foundation for creating and managing Query objects in the larger "farfetched" project. These Query objects are used to fetch and manage data from a remote server, providing a reactive interface for accessing and updating the data.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `QuerySymbol` constant?**
The `QuerySymbol` constant is used as a unique symbol to identify queries. It is likely used internally to differentiate queries from other types of objects.

2. **What is the significance of the `Query` interface extending the `RemoteOperation` interface?**
The `Query` interface extends the `RemoteOperation` interface to inherit its properties and methods. This suggests that a query is a type of remote operation and shares common functionality with other remote operations.

3. **What is the purpose of the `isQuery` function?**
The `isQuery` function is used to check if a given value is an instance of the `Query` interface. It returns `true` if the value has a `kind` property equal to `QuerySymbol`, indicating that it is a query.
