This code defines a function called `createQuery` that is used to create query objects. The purpose of this code is to provide a flexible and configurable way to create queries for a larger project.

The `createQuery` function is overloaded with multiple signatures, each representing a different configuration option for creating a query. The function takes a `config` object as its parameter, which contains various properties that define the behavior of the query.

The `config` object can have the following properties:

- `handler`: A function that takes parameters and returns a promise of a response. This is used when the query does not require an effect or a contract.

- `initialData`: The initial data for the query. This is optional and can be used to provide default data for the query.

- `effect`: An effect that represents the asynchronous operation to be performed by the query. This is used when the query requires an effect.

- `contract`: A contract that defines the expected shape of the response data. This is used when the query requires a contract.

- `mapData`: A function that maps the response data to a different shape. This is used when the query requires mapping the response data.

- `validate`: A validator function that validates the mapped data. This is optional and can be used to perform validation on the mapped data.

- `enabled`: A boolean value that determines whether the query is enabled or not. This is optional and defaults to `true`.

- `name`: A string that represents the name of the query. This is optional and can be used for debugging or logging purposes.

- `serialize`: A function that serializes the query parameters. This is optional and can be used to customize the serialization behavior.

The `createQuery` function internally calls the `createHeadlessQuery` function with the appropriate configuration options to create the query object. It also sets the `executeFx` property of the query object to a resolved version of the `resolveExecuteEffect` function, which is passed the `config` object.

The `createQuery` function then returns the created query object.

Here is an example usage of the `createQuery` function:

```javascript
const myQuery = createQuery({
  initialData: null,
  effect: myEffect,
  contract: myContract,
  mapData: ({ result }) => result,
  validate: myValidator,
  enabled: true,
  name: 'myQuery',
  serialize: mySerializer,
});
```

In this example, a query object is created with the specified configuration options. The resulting query object can then be used to perform queries in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What are the different ways to create a query using the `createQuery` function?
- The `createQuery` function has multiple overloads that allow developers to create queries with different configurations, such as specifying a handler, an effect, a contract, or a combination of these.

2. What is the purpose of the `SharedQueryFactoryConfig` type?
- The `SharedQueryFactoryConfig` type is used as a common configuration interface for all query creation overloads. It contains properties such as `initialData`, `enabled`, `validate`, `name`, and `serialize` that can be used to customize the behavior of the query.

3. What is the purpose of the `resolveExecuteEffect` function?
- The `resolveExecuteEffect` function is used to resolve the execute effect for the query. It takes the configuration object passed to `createQuery` and returns the appropriate execute effect based on the configuration, which is then used by the query.
