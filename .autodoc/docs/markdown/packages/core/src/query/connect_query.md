The code provided is a function called `connectQuery` that is used to establish a connection between a source query and one or more target queries in the larger project. The purpose of this function is to coordinate the execution of the target queries based on the state and results of the source query.

The `connectQuery` function takes an object `args` as its parameter, which contains the `source` and `target` properties. The `source` property represents the source query, while the `target` property can be either a single target query or an array of target queries.

The function begins by determining the `singleParentMode` based on whether the `source` is a single query or an object containing multiple queries. It then initializes the `children` and `parents` variables based on the `target` and `source` properties, respectively.

Next, the function defines several helper units that are used in the coordination of the queries. These include:
- `anyParentStarted`: A signal that indicates whether any of the parent queries have started.
- `anyParentSuccessfullyFinished`: A signal that indicates whether any of the parent queries have successfully finished.
- `$allParentsHaveData`: A store that represents whether all parent queries have data available.
- `$allParentDataDictionary`: A store that contains the data from all parent queries. If `singleParentMode` is true, it contains the data from the single parent query. Otherwise, it combines the data from all parent queries into a dictionary.
- `$allParentParamsDictionary`: A store that contains the parameters from all parent queries. If `singleParentMode` is true, it contains the parameters from the single parent query. Otherwise, it combines the parameters from all parent queries into a dictionary.

Finally, the function establishes the relations between the parent and child queries using the `sample` function from the 'effector' library. It sets the `$stale` property of the child queries to true when any parent query starts. It also triggers the execution of the child queries when all parent queries have successfully finished and have data available. The `mapperFn` function is used to map the data and parameters from the parent queries to the parameters of the child queries.

In summary, the `connectQuery` function provides a way to connect a source query with one or more target queries in the larger project. It coordinates the execution of the target queries based on the state and results of the source query, ensuring that the target queries are executed at the appropriate times and with the correct parameters. This function is a crucial part of the larger project as it enables the efficient and synchronized execution of queries.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `connectQuery` function?
- The `connectQuery` function is used to establish connections between a source query and one or more target queries.

2. What are the conditions for the `fn` parameter to be defined?
- The `fn` parameter is defined if the `Target` type is a query with a non-void payload and the `Sources` type is a query or a record of queries.

3. What is the purpose of the `$allParentsHaveData` store?
- The `$allParentsHaveData` store checks if all parent queries have data by combining the `$data` stores of the parent queries and using a predicate to check if the data is not null.
