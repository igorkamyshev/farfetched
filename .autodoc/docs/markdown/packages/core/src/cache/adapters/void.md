The code provided is a function named `voidCache` that returns a `CacheAdapter` object. This function is part of the larger `farfetched` project and is used to create a cache adapter for caching data.

The `voidCache` function imports two functions, `createEffect` and `createEvent`, from the 'effector' library. It also imports a `createCacheAdapter` function from a local file named 'instance' and a `CacheAdapter` type from another local file named 'type'.

The purpose of the `voidCache` function is to create a cache adapter object that can be used to cache data. The cache adapter object returned by this function has four properties: `get`, `set`, `purge`, and `unset`.

The `get` property is created using the `createEffect` function. It takes an object with a `key` property as input and returns an object with a `value` property and a `cachedAt` property, or `null` if the data is not found in the cache. Here is an example of how the `get` property can be used:

```javascript
const cache = voidCache();
const data = cache.get({ key: 'exampleKey' });
console.log(data); // { value: 'exampleValue', cachedAt: 1621234567890 }
```

The `set` property is also created using the `createEffect` function. It takes an object with a `key` property and a `value` property as input and returns `void`. This property is used to set data in the cache. Here is an example of how the `set` property can be used:

```javascript
const cache = voidCache();
cache.set({ key: 'exampleKey', value: 'exampleValue' });
```

The `purge` property is created using the `createEvent` function. It does not take any input and does not return anything. This property is used to clear the cache. Here is an example of how the `purge` property can be used:

```javascript
const cache = voidCache();
cache.purge();
```

The `unset` property is also created using the `createEffect` function. It takes an object with a `key` property as input and returns `void`. This property is used to remove a specific item from the cache. Here is an example of how the `unset` property can be used:

```javascript
const cache = voidCache();
cache.unset({ key: 'exampleKey' });
```

Overall, the `voidCache` function provides a convenient way to create a cache adapter object with the necessary properties for caching data in the `farfetched` project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `createCacheAdapter` function?
- The `createCacheAdapter` function is used to create a cache adapter object that provides methods for getting, setting, purging, and unsetting cache values.

2. What is the purpose of the `voidCache` function?
- The `voidCache` function returns a cache adapter object created using the `createCacheAdapter` function, with default implementations for the get, set, purge, and unset methods.

3. What is the purpose of the `createEffect` and `createEvent` functions?
- The `createEffect` function is used to create an effect that represents an asynchronous operation, while the `createEvent` function is used to create an event that can be triggered and subscribed to.
