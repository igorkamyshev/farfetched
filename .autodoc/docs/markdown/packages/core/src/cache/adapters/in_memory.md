The code provided is a part of the `farfetched` project and it implements an in-memory cache adapter. The purpose of this code is to provide a caching mechanism for storing and retrieving data in memory. 

The code starts by importing necessary functions and types from external libraries and modules. These include `createEffect`, `createEvent`, `sample`, `scopeBind` from the 'effector' library, `time` from the '../../libs/patronus' module, `parseTime` from the '../../libs/date-nfs' module, and `createCacheAdapter` and `attachObservability` from the './instance' and './observability' modules respectively. It also defines two custom types, `Entry` and `Storage`.

The `inMemoryCache` function is the main function in this code. It takes an optional `config` object as a parameter, which can contain properties like `maxEntries`, `maxAge`, and `observability`. It initializes an empty `storage` object to store the cached data.

The function then creates several events using the `createEvent` function. These events include `saveValue`, `removeValue`, `itemExpired`, `itemEvicted`, and `purge`. These events are used to trigger specific actions in the cache.

The function also creates a `$now` store using the `time` function, which is used to keep track of the current time.

Next, the function defines a `maxEntriesApplied` sample using the `sample` function. This sample is triggered by the `saveValue` event and applies the `maxEntries` limit to the storage. It calls the `applyMaxEntries` function to determine if the storage exceeds the `maxEntries` limit and evicts the oldest entry if necessary. The updated storage is then assigned to the `storage` variable.

The function also defines a sample that triggers the `itemEvicted` event when an entry is evicted from the storage.

The function defines a `removeValue` event handler that removes a specific key from the storage.

If the `maxAge` property is provided in the `config` object, the function sets up a timeout using the `setTimeout` function. This timeout triggers the `itemExpired` event after the specified `maxAge` time has passed. The `itemExpired` event then triggers the `removeValue` event to remove the expired entry from the storage.

The function creates an `adapter` object that contains several methods for interacting with the cache. These methods include `get`, `set`, `unset`, and `purge`. The `get` method retrieves an entry from the storage, checks if it has expired based on the `maxAge` property, and removes it if necessary. The `set` method adds a new entry to the storage. The `unset` method removes a specific entry from the storage. The `purge` method clears the entire storage.

Finally, the function calls the `attachObservability` function to attach observability features to the cache adapter. This allows for monitoring and logging of cache-related events.

The `inMemoryCache` function returns the created cache adapter using the `createCacheAdapter` function.

The `applyMaxEntries` function is a helper function used by the `inMemoryCache` function. It takes the current storage, a new entry, and the `maxEntries` limit as parameters. It checks if the storage exceeds the `maxEntries` limit and evicts the oldest entry if necessary. It returns an object with the updated storage and the evicted key.

Overall, this code provides a flexible and configurable in-memory cache adapter that can be used in the larger `farfetched` project to improve data retrieval performance by caching frequently accessed data.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `inMemoryCache` function?**
The `inMemoryCache` function is responsible for creating an in-memory cache adapter with specified configuration options.

2. **What events trigger the removal of a value from the cache?**
The `removeValue` event triggers the removal of a value from the cache when it is called.

3. **How does the cache handle expired items?**
If the `maxAge` option is provided, the cache sets a timeout for each saved item. When the timeout expires, the `itemExpired` event is triggered, which in turn triggers the `removeValue` event to remove the expired item from the cache.
