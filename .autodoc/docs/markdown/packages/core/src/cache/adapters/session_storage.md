The code provided is a function called `sessionStorageCache` that returns a `CacheAdapter` object. This function is part of the larger `farfetched` project and is used to create a cache adapter specifically for the `sessionStorage` browser storage.

The `sessionStorageCache` function takes an optional `config` parameter, which is an object that can contain options for the cache adapter and serialization configuration. The `config` object is a combination of `CacheAdapterOptions` and `SerializeConfig` types.

The function then calls the `browserStorageCache` function, passing in an object as its argument. This object has a `storage` property that is a function returning the `sessionStorage` object. The `...config` syntax is used to spread the properties of the `config` object into the argument object.

The `browserStorageCache` function is imported from the `browser_storage` module, along with the `SerializeConfig` type. This function is responsible for creating a cache adapter for a given browser storage. It takes an object as its argument, which should have a `storage` property that is a function returning the desired browser storage object.

By using the `sessionStorageCache` function, developers can easily create a cache adapter specifically for the `sessionStorage` browser storage. This cache adapter can then be used in the larger `farfetched` project to store and retrieve data from the `sessionStorage` storage.

Here is an example of how the `sessionStorageCache` function can be used:

```javascript
import { sessionStorageCache } from 'farfetched';

const cacheAdapter = sessionStorageCache();
// Use the cache adapter to store and retrieve data from sessionStorage
```

In this example, the `sessionStorageCache` function is called without any arguments, using the default configuration. The returned `cacheAdapter` object can then be used to interact with the `sessionStorage` storage.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `browserStorageCache` function and the `SerializeConfig` and `CacheAdapter` imports?**
The `browserStorageCache` function is likely used to create a cache adapter for browser storage, and the `SerializeConfig` and `CacheAdapter` imports are likely used to define the types and options for this cache adapter.

2. **What is the purpose of the `sessionStorageCache` function and how does it differ from the `browserStorageCache` function?**
The `sessionStorageCache` function is likely used to create a cache adapter specifically for session storage, and it may have additional options or configurations specific to session storage.

3. **What does the `storage: () => sessionStorage` line do?**
This line sets the `storage` option of the `browserStorageCache` function to a function that returns the `sessionStorage` object. This allows the cache adapter to use session storage as the underlying storage mechanism.
