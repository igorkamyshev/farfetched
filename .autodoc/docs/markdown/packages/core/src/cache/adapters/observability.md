The code provided is a function called `attachObservability` that is used to attach observability to a cache adapter. The purpose of this code is to enable the tracking and monitoring of cache events such as cache hits, cache misses, expired items, and evicted items. 

The function takes in an object as its parameter, which includes the following properties:
- `adapter`: This property represents the cache adapter instance that will be used for caching. It is of type `CacheAdapterInstance`.
- `options`: This property represents the options for observability. It is an optional property and is of type `CacheAdapterOptions['observability']`.
- `events`: This property represents the events related to cache observability. It is an optional property and includes two events: `itemExpired` and `itemEvicted`. These events are of type `Event<{ key: string; value: unknown }>` and `Event<{ key: string }>` respectively.

The function then checks for the presence of certain options and events and performs the following actions accordingly:

1. If the `options.hit` property is present, it sets up a `sample` effect that triggers when the `adapter.get.done` event occurs and the result is not null. It uses the `filter` function to check if the result is not null, and if true, it calls the `fn` function to extract the key from the `params` object and returns an object with the key. The resulting object is then sent to the `options.hit` target.

2. If the `options.miss` property is present, it sets up a `sample` effect that triggers when the `adapter.get.done` event occurs and the result is null. It uses the `filter` function to check if the result is null, and if true, it calls the `fn` function to extract the key from the `params` object and returns an object with the key. The resulting object is then sent to the `options.miss` target.

3. If the `options.expired` property and the `events.itemExpired` event are present, it sets up a `sample` effect that triggers when the `events.itemExpired` event occurs. It calls the `fn` function to extract the key from the event object and returns an object with the key. The resulting object is then sent to the `options.expired` target.

4. If the `options.evicted` property and the `events.itemEvicted` event are present, it sets up a `sample` effect that triggers when the `events.itemEvicted` event occurs. The resulting event is sent to the `options.evicted` target.

In summary, this code provides a way to attach observability to a cache adapter by setting up different `sample` effects based on the provided options and events. These effects allow for tracking and monitoring of cache hits, cache misses, expired items, and evicted items. This functionality can be useful in a larger project where cache performance and behavior need to be monitored and analyzed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `attachObservability` function?
- The `attachObservability` function is responsible for attaching observability to a cache adapter, allowing developers to track events such as cache hits, misses, expired items, and evicted items.

2. What are the possible values for the `options` parameter?
- The `options` parameter can have properties such as `hit`, `miss`, `expired`, and `evicted`, which are used to specify the target events for different observability scenarios.

3. What are the possible events that can be passed in the `events` parameter?
- The `events` parameter can contain `itemExpired` and `itemEvicted` events, which are used to trigger observability actions when an item in the cache expires or is evicted.
