The code provided is a module that exports two functions: `linearDelay` and `exponentialDelay`. These functions are used to calculate the delay time for retrying an operation in a larger project called "farfetched".

The `linearDelay` function takes a `base` number and an optional `opts` object as parameters. The `base` number represents the base delay time for each retry attempt. The `opts` object is an optional parameter that allows customization of the delay behavior. If no `opts` object is provided, the function uses the `defaultOptions` object.

The `linearDelay` function returns another function that takes a `RetryMeta` object as a parameter. The `RetryMeta` object contains information about the current retry attempt. The returned function calculates the delay time by multiplying the `base` number with the `attempt` property of the `RetryMeta` object and adds a random addition generated by the `randomAddition` function.

The `exponentialDelay` function has a similar structure to the `linearDelay` function, but instead of multiplying the `base` number with the `attempt` property, it raises the `base` number to the power of the `attempt` property.

The `randomAddition` function takes a `DelayOptions` object as a parameter and extracts the `spread` property from the `randomize` property of the `DelayOptions` object. It then generates a random number between `-spread` and `spread` using the `randomNumber` function from the `lohyphen` library.

Overall, this code provides a way to calculate the delay time for retrying an operation in the larger "farfetched" project. The `linearDelay` and `exponentialDelay` functions allow for customization of the delay behavior by providing a base delay time and optional options. The `randomAddition` function adds a random component to the delay time.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `linearDelay` function?
- The `linearDelay` function calculates the delay for retrying an operation based on a linear formula, using the `base` value and the number of `attempt`s made.

2. What is the purpose of the `exponentialDelay` function?
- The `exponentialDelay` function calculates the delay for retrying an operation based on an exponential formula, using the `base` value and the number of `attempt`s made.

3. What is the purpose of the `randomAddition` function?
- The `randomAddition` function generates a random number within a specified range (`-spread` to `spread`) to add to the calculated delay.
