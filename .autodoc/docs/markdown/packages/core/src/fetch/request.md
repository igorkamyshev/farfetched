The code provided is a part of the farfetched project and it defines a function called `requestFx`. This function is a basic request effect that wraps around another function called `fetchFx`. The purpose of `requestFx` is to handle HTTP requests and provide some additional features.

The `requestFx` function is created using the `createEffect` function from the 'effector' library. It takes three generic parameters: `Request`, `Response`, and `NetworkError | HttpError`. These parameters define the types of the request, response, and error objects that can be used with this effect.

Inside the `requestFx` function, there is an asynchronous handler function that takes a `request` object as a parameter. This handler function first calls the `fetchFx` function with the `request` object to make the actual HTTP request. If an error occurs during the fetch operation, it catches the error and throws a `NetworkError` using the `networkError` function from the '../errors/create_error' module. The `NetworkError` object includes the error message and the original error as its cause.

If the response from the fetch operation is not successful (i.e., the `ok` property of the response is false), it throws an `HttpError` using the `httpError` function from the '../errors/create_error' module. The `HttpError` object includes the status code, status text, and the response body (if available) as properties.

If the response is successful, it simply returns the response object.

The `requestFx` function can be used in the larger project to handle HTTP requests and handle errors in a consistent manner. It provides a convenient way to make HTTP requests and automatically handles network errors and HTTP errors. Here's an example of how `requestFx` can be used:

```typescript
import { requestFx } from 'farfetched';

const request = {
  method: 'GET',
  url: 'https://api.example.com/data',
};

requestFx(request)
  .then((response) => {
    // Handle successful response
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle error
    console.error(error);
  });
```

In this example, `requestFx` is called with a request object that specifies the HTTP method and URL. The function returns a promise that resolves to the response object if the request is successful, or rejects with an error object if an error occurs. The response or error can then be handled accordingly in the `then` and `catch` blocks.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `requestFx` function?
- The `requestFx` function is a basic request effect that wraps around the `fetchFx` function and adds additional features such as throwing errors for 4XX/5XX response statuses and throwing a serializable `NetworkError` instead of a `TypeError`.

2. What are the input and output types for the `requestFx` function?
- The `requestFx` function takes a `Request` object as input and returns a `Response` object. It can also throw either a `NetworkError` or an `HttpError`.

3. What is the purpose of the `fetchFx` function and where is it defined?
- The `fetchFx` function is used within the `requestFx` function to make the actual HTTP request. However, its definition is not provided in the given code snippet, so it would be necessary to look for its implementation elsewhere in the project.
