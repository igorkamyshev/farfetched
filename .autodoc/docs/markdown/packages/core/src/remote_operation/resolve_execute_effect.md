The code provided is a function called `resolveExecuteEffect` and a class called `InvalidConfigException`. The purpose of this code is to provide a utility function that resolves and returns an `Effect` object based on the provided configuration.

The `resolveExecuteEffect` function takes in a `config` parameter, which can be either an object with a `handler` property or an object with an `effect` property. The `handler` property is a function that takes in `Params` as input and returns a `Promise` of `Response`. The `effect` property is an instance of the `Effect` class, which also takes in `Params` as input and returns a `Promise` of `Response`. The function returns an `Effect` object that matches the provided configuration.

Here's an example of how this function can be used:

```javascript
import { createEffect, Effect } from 'effector';

const fetchData = async (params) => {
  // fetch data based on params
  return response;
};

const effect = createEffect(fetchData);

const resolvedEffect = resolveExecuteEffect({ effect });
```

In this example, the `fetchData` function is a handler that takes in `params` and returns a `Promise` of the fetched data. The `createEffect` function is used to create an `Effect` object based on the `fetchData` handler. The `resolveExecuteEffect` function is then called with the `effect` property set to the created `Effect` object, and it returns the same `Effect` object.

If the `config` parameter does not have either a `handler` or an `effect` property, an `InvalidConfigException` is thrown with an error message indicating that either a `handler` or an `effect` must be passed to the config.

The `InvalidConfigException` class is a custom exception class that extends the built-in `Error` class. It takes in a `message` parameter and sets it as the error message for the exception.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to resolve and return an `Effect` object based on the provided configuration, allowing for flexible usage of the `Effect` class in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `resolveExecuteEffect` function?**
The `resolveExecuteEffect` function is used to create an `Effect` object that can either be based on a provided handler function or an existing `Effect` object.

2. **What is the purpose of the `InvalidConfigException` class?**
The `InvalidConfigException` class is used to define a custom exception that is thrown when the `resolveExecuteEffect` function is called with an invalid configuration.

3. **What is the purpose of the `is.effect` function?**
The `is.effect` function is used to check if a given object is an instance of the `Effect` class from the 'effector' library.
