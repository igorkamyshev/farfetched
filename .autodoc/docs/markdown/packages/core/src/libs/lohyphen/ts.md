The code provided is a TypeScript type definition for a type called `NonOptionalKeys`. This type is used to extract the keys from an object type `T` that are not optional, meaning they do not allow `undefined` as a value.

The `NonOptionalKeys` type is defined using mapped types and conditional types in TypeScript. Let's break down the code to understand how it works:

```typescript
export type NonOptionalKeys<T> = {
  [k in keyof T]-?: undefined extends T[k] ? never : k;
}[keyof T];
```

- The `NonOptionalKeys` type is exported, which means it can be used outside of this file.
- It takes a generic type `T` as a parameter, which represents the object type from which we want to extract the non-optional keys.
- The type definition uses a mapped type to iterate over each key `k` in the `keyof T` (the keys of `T`) and applies a conditional type to determine if the key is non-optional.
- The conditional type checks if `undefined` extends the type of the value associated with the key `T[k]`. If it does, it means the key is optional and should be excluded from the resulting type. If it doesn't, it means the key is non-optional and should be included in the resulting type.
- The resulting type is an object with the non-optional keys as its keys, and the values are of type `never`. The `never` type is used here to create a type that cannot be instantiated, effectively excluding the optional keys from the resulting type.
- Finally, the `[keyof T]` index access type is used to obtain the union of all the keys in the resulting object type.

This `NonOptionalKeys` type can be used in the larger project to enforce the presence of certain keys in an object type. By using this type, developers can ensure that certain properties are required and cannot be omitted or set to `undefined`. This can help prevent potential bugs and improve the reliability of the code.

Here's an example of how the `NonOptionalKeys` type can be used:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age?: number;
  address: string;
}

type RequiredKeys = NonOptionalKeys<Person>;
// The type RequiredKeys is "name" | "address"
```

In this example, the `RequiredKeys` type is assigned the result of applying the `NonOptionalKeys` type to the `Person` interface. The resulting type is a union of the non-optional keys from the `Person` interface, which are "name" and "address".
## Questions: 
 1. **What does the `NonOptionalKeys` type do?**
The `NonOptionalKeys` type is a mapped type that takes an input type `T` and returns a union of all the keys in `T` that are not optional (i.e., keys that do not have the `undefined` type as a possible value).

2. **What does the `-?` syntax mean in the `NonOptionalKeys` type?**
The `-?` syntax is used to make all the keys in `T` required. It removes the optional modifier (`?`) from each key in `T`.

3. **What does the `never` type represent in the `NonOptionalKeys` type?**
The `never` type is used as a placeholder to exclude keys from the resulting union type. In this case, it is used to exclude keys that have the `undefined` type as a possible value from the union of non-optional keys.
