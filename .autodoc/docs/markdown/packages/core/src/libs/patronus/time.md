The code provided is a part of the larger project called "farfetched". This specific code file is responsible for handling time-related functionality. It exports a function called "time" that takes an object as an argument with a property called "clock". The "clock" property can be either an Event or an Effect from the "effector" library.

The purpose of the "time" function is to create and return a Store that holds the current time. The Store is essentially a state container that can be subscribed to and updated. In this case, the Store will hold the current time as a number.

Inside the "time" function, a new Store called "$time" is created using the "createStore" function from the "effector" library. The initial value of the Store is set to the current time using the "Date.now()" function.

The "sample" function from the "effector" library is then used twice. The first "sample" call is used to sample the value of the "clock" Event or Effect. This means that whenever the "clock" Event or Effect is triggered, the "sample" function will be called. However, in this case, the "fn" parameter is empty, so no actual logic is executed when the "clock" is triggered.

The second "sample" call is used to sample the value of the "readNowFx.doneData" Event. This Event is triggered when the "readNowFx" Effect is done executing. The value of the "readNowFx.doneData" Event is then assigned to the "$time" Store, effectively updating its value to the current time.

Finally, the "$time" Store is returned from the "time" function, allowing other parts of the project to subscribe to and use the current time.

Here is an example of how this code can be used in the larger project:

```javascript
import { time } from 'farfetched';

const currentTime = time({ clock: someEvent });

currentTime.watch((value) => {
  console.log('Current time:', value);
});

// Output: Current time: 1631234567890
```

In this example, the "time" function is called with an Event called "someEvent" as the "clock" argument. The returned Store, "currentTime", is then subscribed to using the "watch" method. Whenever the "someEvent" is triggered, the "currentTime" Store will be updated with the current time, and the callback function will be called, logging the current time to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `readNowFx` effect?
- The `readNowFx` effect is used to get the current timestamp using `Date.now()`.

2. What is the purpose of the `time` function?
- The `time` function takes a `clock` event or effect as input and returns a store that holds the current timestamp.

3. What is the purpose of the `sample` calls in the `time` function?
- The first `sample` call samples the `clock` event or effect and assigns the result to the `readNowFx` effect. The second `sample` call samples the `readNowFx.doneData` event and assigns the result to the `$time` store.
