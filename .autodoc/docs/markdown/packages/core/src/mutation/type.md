The code provided defines a `Mutation` interface and a `isMutation` function. These are used in the larger project to handle remote operations and mutations.

The `Mutation` interface extends the `RemoteOperation` interface, which is likely defined in the `remote_operation` module. The `RemoteOperation` interface specifies the shape of a remote operation, including the parameters, data, and error types. The `Mutation` interface adds an additional property `@@unitShape`, which is a function that returns an object with two properties: `start` and `pending`. `start` is an `Event` that represents the start of the mutation, and `pending` is a `Store` that holds a boolean value indicating whether the mutation is currently pending.

Here is an example of how the `Mutation` interface may be used in the larger project:

```typescript
import { createEvent, createStore } from 'effector';

// Define a mutation
const myMutation: Mutation<{ id: number }, { success: boolean }, Error> = {
  '@@unitShape': () => ({
    start: createEvent(),
    pending: createStore(false),
  }),
  // ... other properties from RemoteOperation interface
};

// Check if a value is a mutation
if (isMutation(myMutation)) {
  // Perform mutation
  myMutation['@@unitShape'].start();
}
```

The `isMutation` function is a type guard that checks if a given value is an instance of the `Mutation` interface. It does this by checking if the value has a property `__` with a `kind` property equal to `MutationSymbol`. This function can be used to determine if a value is a mutation before performing any mutation-related operations.

Overall, this code provides a way to define and handle mutations in the larger project. Mutations are remote operations that can be triggered and tracked using the `start` event and `pending` store respectively. The `isMutation` function allows for type checking and validation of mutation instances.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MutationSymbol` constant?
- The `MutationSymbol` constant is used as a unique identifier for identifying mutations in the code.

2. What is the purpose of the `Mutation` interface?
- The `Mutation` interface extends the `RemoteOperation` interface and adds additional properties and methods specific to mutations.

3. What is the purpose of the `isMutation` function?
- The `isMutation` function is used to check if a given value is an instance of the `Mutation` interface.
