The code provided is a module that exports a function called `createMutation`. This function is used to create a mutation object that can be used in the larger project. The purpose of this code is to provide a convenient way to create mutations with different configurations based on the provided parameters.

The `createMutation` function has multiple overloaded signatures, each with different sets of parameters. These overloaded signatures allow the function to handle different use cases and provide flexibility to the users of this code. The function takes a configuration object as its parameter, which can include properties like `handler`, `effect`, `contract`, and other shared configuration options.

The function first calls the `createHeadlessMutation` function, passing in some properties from the configuration object. This `createHeadlessMutation` function is imported from another module called `create_headless_mutation`. It is responsible for creating a mutation object with some default properties.

After creating the mutation object, the code sets the `executeFx` property of the mutation object to a resolved value of the `resolveExecuteEffect` function. The `resolveExecuteEffect` function is imported from another module called `resolve_execute_effect`. It is responsible for resolving the execute effect based on the provided configuration.

Finally, the function returns the created mutation object.

Overall, this code provides a reusable function that can be used to create mutation objects with different configurations. These mutation objects can then be used in the larger project to perform mutations based on the provided parameters and configuration options. Here's an example of how this code can be used:

```javascript
import { createMutation } from 'farfetched';

const myMutation = createMutation({
  handler: (params) => {
    // Perform some mutation logic here
    return Promise.resolve('Mutation result');
  },
  name: 'MyMutation',
  enabled: true,
});

myMutation.execute({ param1: 'value1', param2: 'value2' })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // Output: 'Mutation result'
  });
```

In this example, a mutation object is created using the `createMutation` function. The `handler` property is provided, which defines the logic for performing the mutation. The `name` and `enabled` properties are also provided to configure the mutation object. The `execute` method of the mutation object is then called with some parameters, and the result of the mutation is logged to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `createMutation` function?**
The `createMutation` function is used to create a mutation object that encapsulates the logic for executing a mutation operation. It can be configured with different options such as a handler function, an effect, and a contract.

2. **What are the different overloads of the `createMutation` function and when should each be used?**
The `createMutation` function has three different overloads. The first overload should be used when only a handler function is provided. The second overload should be used when only an effect is provided. The third overload should be used when both an effect and a contract are provided.

3. **What is the purpose of the `createHeadlessMutation` function and how is it used in the `createMutation` function?**
The `createHeadlessMutation` function is used to create a mutation object without any specific implementation details. It is used in the `createMutation` function to initialize the `mutation` object with the provided configuration options such as the name, enabled status, contract, and data mapping function.
