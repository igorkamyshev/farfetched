The code provided is a module that contains functions related to attaching operations to queries and mutations in the larger project called "farfetched". The purpose of this code is to provide a convenient way to attach operations to queries and mutations, allowing for easier management and execution of remote operations.

The code starts by importing necessary dependencies from other modules in the project. These dependencies include the `createStore` function and the `Store` type from the 'effector' module, as well as various types related to mutations, queries, and remote operations.

The code then defines a series of overloaded functions named `attachOperation`. These functions allow for attaching operations to queries and mutations with different configurations and parameters. The function signatures indicate that the `attachOperation` function can accept different combinations of parameters, depending on the type of operation being attached.

The first set of overloaded functions is related to attaching operations to queries. These functions take an operation of type `Q` (which extends the `Query` type) and a configuration object. The configuration object specifies the source of the operation and a function to map the parameters of the operation. The return type of these functions is a `Query` with the appropriate type parameters.

The second set of overloaded functions is related to attaching operations to mutations. These functions are similar to the ones for queries, but they take an operation of type `M` (which extends the `Mutation` type) instead. The configuration object for mutations also includes a source and a parameter mapping function.

The final set of overloaded functions is a generic implementation of `attachOperation`. This function can accept any type of operation (`O`) that extends the `RemoteOperation` type. It also accepts an optional configuration object that includes a source and a parameter mapping function. If no configuration is provided, default values are used.

The implementation of the `attachOperation` function creates a new operation by calling the `attach` method on the `experimentalAPI` property of the operation object. It uses the provided or default values for the source and parameter mapping functions.

In summary, this code provides a flexible and reusable way to attach operations to queries and mutations in the larger "farfetched" project. It allows for easy configuration and management of remote operations, enhancing the overall functionality and maintainability of the project.
## Questions: 
 **1. What is the purpose of the `attachOperation` function?**

The `attachOperation` function is used to attach an operation (either a query or a mutation) to a source and map its parameters.

**2. What are the different overloads of the `attachOperation` function?**

There are two sets of overloads for the `attachOperation` function: one for queries and one for mutations. Each set has three overloads, allowing for different combinations of parameters and configurations.

**3. What does the `attachOperation` function do if no configuration is provided?**

If no configuration is provided, the `attachOperation` function will use default values for the `source` and `mapParams` parameters. The default `source` is a store with a null initial value, and the default `mapParams` function simply returns the parameters as is.
