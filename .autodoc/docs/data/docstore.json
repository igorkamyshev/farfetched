It is likely a part of the larger Farfetched project, which is a web application that may involve the use of React or a similar JavaScript framework.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to define the structure and initial content of the web page. It includes the necessary HTML tags and attributes to create a basic webpage layout. Let's break down the code:\n\n- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This is the document type declaration, which specifies that the document is an HTML5 document.\n- `<html lang=\"en\">`: This tag represents the root element of an HTML page and specifies the language of the document.\n- `<head>`: This section contains meta-information about the document, such as the character encoding, title, and viewport settings.\n- `<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />`: This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the document.\n- `<title>Breaking Bad and Farfetched</title>`: This tag sets the title of the webpage, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.\n- `<base href=\"/\" />`: This tag specifies the base URL for all relative URLs within the document.\n- `<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />`: This meta tag sets the viewport properties, which control how the webpage is displayed on different devices.\n- `<link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"favicon.ico\" />`: This link tag specifies the favicon, which is the small icon displayed in the browser's tab or bookmark bar.\n\nThe body of the HTML document contains the main content of the webpage. In this case, it includes a single div element with the id \"root\". This div is likely the mount point for the React or JavaScript application.\n\nFinally, the code includes a script tag that references a JavaScript file located at \"/src/main.tsx\". This file is likely the entry point for the JavaScript application and may contain the logic and components that make up the Farfetched web application.\n\nOverall, this code sets up the basic structure and initial content of the webpage, and it includes a reference to the main JavaScript file that powers the Farfetched application.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `base` tag?**\nThe `base` tag is used to specify the base URL for all relative URLs in the document. It helps in resolving relative URLs correctly.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `viewport` meta tag?**\nThe `viewport` meta tag is used to control the layout and scaling of the webpage on different devices. It ensures that the webpage is displayed correctly on various screen sizes.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `type=\"module\"` attribute in the script tag?**\nThe `type=\"module\"` attribute indicates that the script is a JavaScript module. It allows the use of modern JavaScript features and enables the use of `import` and `export` statements for module dependencies.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/forest-real-world-breaking-bad/index.md"}}],["1",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/forest-real-world-breaking-bad/project.json)\n\nThe code provided is a configuration file for a project called \"farfetched\". This configuration file is specific to a sub-project within farfetched called \"showcase-forest-real-world-breaking-bad\". The purpose of this code is to define the build, serve, lint, and preview targets for this sub-project.\n\nThe \"build\" target is responsible for building the project using the \"@nrwl/vite:build\" executor.

The `Quote` data structure consists of two properties: `author` and `quote`, both of which are of type `String`.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way of representing a quote within the larger project. By defining the `Quote` data structure, the code ensures that any quote used in the project will have the same structure and data types for its properties. This promotes consistency and makes it easier to work with quotes throughout the project.\n\nThe `Quote` data structure can be used in various parts of the project. For example, it can be used to store quotes in a database, pass quotes between different components or modules, or validate the structure of a quote received from an external API.\n\nHere's an example of how the `Quote` data structure can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Quote } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst quote = {\n  author: 'Albert Einstein',\n  quote: 'Imagination is more important than knowledge.',\n};\n\n// Validate the quote using the Quote data structure\nconst validatedQuote = Quote.check(quote);\n\n// Use the quote in the project\nconsole.log(validatedQuote.author); // Output: 'Albert Einstein'\nconsole.log(validatedQuote.quote); // Output: 'Imagination is more important than knowledge.'\n```\n\nIn the example above, we import the `Quote` data structure from the `farfetched` module. We then create a quote object with an `author` and `quote` property. We can then use the `Quote.check()` method to validate the quote object against the `Quote` data structure. If the quote object matches the structure defined by `Quote`, the method will return the validated quote object. We can then access the properties of the validated quote object and use them in the project.\n\nOverall, this code provides a standardized way of representing quotes in the larger project, ensuring consistency and facilitating the handling of quotes throughout the codebase.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `Record` function?**\nThe `Record` function is used to define a data structure with specific properties and their corresponding types.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `String` function?**\nThe `String` function is used to define the type of a property as a string.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `Quote` constant?**\nThe `Quote` constant is used to create a new record type called \"Quote\" with properties \"author\" and \"quote\", both of which are of type string.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/forest-real-world-breaking-bad/src/features/quote/contract.md"}}],["3",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/forest-real-world-breaking-bad/src/features/quote/index.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a module that exports the `RandomQuotesView` class from a file located at `./view`. \n\nThe `RandomQuotesView` class is likely a component or view that is used to display random quotes in the larger project. It is exported so that it can be imported and used in other parts of the project.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a reusable component for displaying random quotes. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as displaying a random quote on a website homepage, in a sidebar, or as a part of a larger application feature.\n\nTo use the `RandomQuotesView` class, it needs to be imported into another file in the project. For example:\n\n```javascript\nimport { RandomQuotesView } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst randomQuotesView = new RandomQuotesView();\nrandomQuotesView.render();\n```\n\nIn this example, the `RandomQuotesView` class is imported from the `farfetched` module and instantiated as `randomQuotesView`. The `render` method is then called on the instance to display the random quote.\n\nThe `RandomQuotesView` class likely has methods and properties that handle the logic of fetching and displaying random quotes. It may use APIs or data sources to retrieve the quotes and update the view accordingly.\n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable component for displaying random quotes in the larger project.

This module is responsible for creating a JSON query to retrieve random quotes from the Breaking Bad Quotes API. \n\nThe module imports several functions and types from different libraries and modules. It imports the `createJsonQuery` and `declareParams` functions from the `@farfetched/core` module, the `runtypeContract` function from the `@farfetched/runtypes` module, and the `Array` type from the `runtypes` library. It also imports the `Quote` type from a local `contract` module.\n\nThe `randomQuotesQuery` constant is exported from this module. It is a function that creates a JSON query for retrieving random quotes. The function takes an object as an argument, which includes the `amount` parameter. The `amount` parameter specifies the number of random quotes to retrieve.\n\nThe `randomQuotesQuery` function uses the `createJsonQuery` function to define the JSON query. It specifies the `params` as an object with a single property `amount`, which is declared using the `declareParams` function. The `initialData` is set to an empty array.\n\nThe `request` property of the JSON query specifies the HTTP method as `GET` and the URL as a template string. The URL is constructed using the `amount` parameter to specify the number of quotes to retrieve from the Breaking Bad Quotes API.\n\nThe `response` property of the JSON query specifies the contract for the response data. It uses the `runtypeContract` function to define the contract as an array of `Quote` objects.\n\nOverall, this module provides a convenient way to create a JSON query for retrieving random quotes from the Breaking Bad Quotes API. It abstracts away the details of constructing the query and provides a contract for the response data. This module can be used in the larger farfetched project to fetch random quotes and handle the response data in a structured manner.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `createJsonQuery` function and how does it work?\n- The `createJsonQuery` function is used to create a JSON query for making HTTP requests. It takes in an object with parameters such as `params`, `initialData`, `request`, and `response` to configure the query.\n\n2. What is the role of the `runtypeContract` function and how is it used in this code?\n- The `runtypeContract` function is used to define a contract for validating the response data. In this code, it is used to define a contract for an array of `Quote` objects.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `randomQuotesQuery` constant and how is it used?\n- The `randomQuotesQuery` constant is a JSON query object that is configured to make a GET request to the Breaking Bad Quotes API. It takes in a parameter `amount` and returns an array of `Quote` objects as the response data. It can be used to fetch random quotes from the API by providing the desired amount.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/forest-real-world-breaking-bad/src/features/quote/query.md"}}],["5",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/forest-real-world-breaking-bad/src/features/quote/view.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a module that defines a view component called `RandomQuotesView`. This component is responsible for rendering a form that allows the user to load and display a list of random quotes. The component uses the `effector` and `forest` libraries for state management and UI rendering, respectively.\n\nThe `RandomQuotesView` function initializes the necessary events and stores for managing the state of the component. It creates an event called `changeAmount` which is used to update the amount of quotes to be loaded. The amount is stored in a store called `$amount`, which is initialized with a default value of 1.\n\nThe component also defines an event called `loadQuotes`, which is triggered when the form is submitted. This event samples the current value of `$amount` and passes it as a parameter to the `randomQuotesQuery.start` event. This event is responsible for fetching the random quotes from the server.\n\nThe component then renders a form using the `h` function from the `forest` library. The form contains an input field for specifying the amount of quotes to load, a label, and a submit button. The value of the input field is bound to the `$amount` store, and any changes to the input field trigger the `changeAmount` event.\n\nWhen the form is submitted, the `loadQuotes` event is triggered, which in turn triggers the `randomQuotesQuery.start` event with the sampled amount of quotes. The quotes are fetched from the server and stored in the `randomQuotesQuery.$data` store.\n\nThe component also defines a route using the `route` function from the `forest` library. This route listens to changes in the `randomQuotesQuery.$data` store and renders the list of quotes if there are any. The list is rendered as an ordered list (`ol`), with each quote item rendered as a list item (`li`). The author and quote values are extracted from each quote item using the `remap` function, and then rendered using the `val` function.\n\nIn summary, the `RandomQuotesView` component allows the user to load and display a list of random quotes. The user can specify the amount of quotes to load through an input field, and the quotes are fetched from the server and rendered in a list. This component can be used as part of a larger project that requires a random quotes feature.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `randomQuotesQuery` and how is it used in this code?\n- The `randomQuotesQuery` is likely a query function that retrieves random quotes. It is used as the source for the `route` function and the `list` function to display the random quotes.\n\n2. How does the `changeAmount` event and `$amount` store work together?\n- The `changeAmount` event is triggered when the input value for the amount changes. It updates the `$amount` store with the new value, which is then used as the source for the `sample` function to determine the amount of random quotes to load.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `extractNumber` function and how is it used?\n- The `extractNumber` function is likely used to extract the numeric value from the input event. It is used as a handler for the `input` event of the input element, and is passed to the `changeAmount.prepend` function to transform the input event before it is passed to the `changeAmount` event.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/forest-real-world-breaking-bad/src/features/quote/view.md"}}],["6",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/forest-real-world-breaking-bad/src/main.tsx)\n\nThe code provided is a part of the farfetched project and it serves the purpose of rendering a web page with a title and a random quote from the TV show \"Breaking Bad\". \n\nThe code starts by importing the `h` and `using` functions from the 'forest' module. These functions are used for creating and rendering HTML elements respectively. \n\nNext, the code imports the `RandomQuotesView` component from the './features/quote' file. This component is responsible for fetching a random quote from the Breaking Bad API and rendering it on the web page.\n\nThe `using` function is then called with the argument `document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement`. This function is used to specify the root element in the HTML document where the web page will be rendered. In this case, it is the element with the id 'root'.\n\nInside the `using` function, the `h` function is called to create an `h1` element with the text 'Breaking Bad 💙 Farfetched'. This element represents the title of the web page.\n\nFinally, the `RandomQuotesView` function is called. This function is responsible for fetching a random quote and rendering it on the web page. It may use AJAX or fetch requests to communicate with the Breaking Bad API and retrieve the quote data. The quote is then rendered as an HTML element on the web page.\n\nOverall, this code sets up the basic structure of the web page and includes the functionality to fetch and display random quotes from the Breaking Bad TV show. It can be used as a starting point for building a larger project that involves displaying quotes or other data from external APIs.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This property is used to get the numeric value of an input element, such as a text field or a range input. \n\nNext, the function checks if the extracted value is NaN (Not a Number) using the `Number.isNaN()` method. If the value is indeed NaN, it means that the extracted value is not a valid number. In this case, the function returns a default value of 1.\n\nIf the extracted value is a valid number, it is returned as is.\n\nThis function can be used in various scenarios where a number value needs to be extracted from an event object. For example, it can be used in a form validation process where the user is expected to enter a numeric value in an input field.

It is used to configure the TypeScript compiler for the farfetched project. The file is located in the `farfetched` directory.\n\nThe configuration file specifies various compiler options that determine how TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript. Let's go through some of the key options:\n\n- `\"extends\": \"../../../tsconfig.base.json\"`: This option extends the configuration from a base `tsconfig.base.json` file located three directories above the current directory. This allows the project to inherit common compiler options from the base configuration.\n\n- `\"compilerOptions\"`: This section contains a set of options that customize the behavior of the TypeScript compiler. Some notable options include:\n  - `\"target\": \"ESNext\"`: This option sets the target ECMAScript version to ESNext, which represents the latest version of ECMAScript.\n  - `\"module\": \"ESNext\"`: This option specifies the module system to be used. In this case, it is set to ESNext, which supports the latest module syntax.\n  - `\"strict\": true`: This option enables strict type-checking and stricter compiler settings to catch potential errors.\n  - `\"resolveJsonModule\": true`: This option allows importing JSON files as modules, which can be useful for working with JSON data in the project.\n  - `\"lib\": [\"DOM\", \"DOM.Iterable\", \"ESNext\"]`: This option specifies the libraries that are available to the project. In this case, it includes the DOM and DOM.Iterable libraries, as well as ESNext.\n\n- `\"include\": [\"**/*.js\", \"**/*.ts\", \"src\"]`: This option specifies the files and directories that should be included in the compilation process. It includes all JavaScript and TypeScript files in the project, as well as the `src` directory.\n\nOverall, this configuration file ensures that the TypeScript compiler is set up with the appropriate options for the farfetched project. It sets the target ECMAScript version, module system, strict type-checking, and includes the necessary libraries. By using this configuration file, developers can compile their TypeScript code into JavaScript that is compatible with the project's requirements.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `extends` property in the `tsconfig.json` file?**\nThe `extends` property is used to inherit compiler options from a base configuration file (`tsconfig.base.json` in this case), allowing for easier management and reuse of common configuration settings.\n\n2. **Why is the `noEmit` property set to `true`?**\nThe `noEmit` property is set to `true` to prevent the TypeScript compiler from generating any output files (e.g., JavaScript files). This is useful when the code is being transpiled and bundled by a separate build tool or when the code is being used in a development environment where the output files are not needed.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `include` property and its glob patterns?**\nThe `include` property specifies which files should be included in the compilation process. The glob patterns (`**/*.js`, `**/*.ts`, `src`) indicate that all JavaScript and TypeScript files in the project's directory structure should be included, as well as any files in the `src` directory.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/forest-real-world-breaking-bad/tsconfig.md"}}],["10",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/forest-real-world-breaking-bad/vite.config.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a configuration file for the Vite build tool.

In this case, the `defineConfig` function is imported from the 'vite' package, and the `vite-tsconfig-paths` module is imported as `tsconfigPaths`.\n\nThe `defineConfig` function is then called with an object as its argument. This object contains various configuration options for Vite. Let's go through each option:\n\n1. `cacheDir`: This option specifies the directory where Vite should store its cache. In this case, the cache directory is set to `'../../../node_modules/.vite/showcase-forest-real-world-breaking-bad'`. This means that Vite will store its cache in the specified directory relative to the current file.\n\n2. `plugins`: This option is an array of plugins to be used by Vite. In this case, the `tsconfigPaths` plugin is included. This plugin allows Vite to resolve module imports using the paths specified in the TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json).\n\n3. `build`: This option configures the build output of Vite. The `outDir` property specifies the directory where the built files should be outputted. In this case, the output directory is set to `'../../../dist/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty'`.\n\nOverall, this configuration file sets up Vite to use the `tsconfigPaths` plugin for resolving module imports and specifies the cache and build output directories.

The `lang` attribute specifies the language of the document.\n\n- `<head>`: This tag contains metadata about the HTML document, such as the character encoding, title, and links to external resources.\n\n- `<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />`: This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the document.\n\n- `<title>Pokemons and Farfetched</title>`: This tag sets the title of the web page, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.\n\n- `<base href=\"/\" />`: This tag specifies the base URL for all relative URLs within the document.\n\n- `<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />`: This meta tag sets the viewport properties, which control how the web page is displayed on different devices.\n\n- `<link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"favicon.ico\" />`: This link tag specifies the favicon (short for \"favorite icon\") for the web page, which is displayed in the browser's tab or bookmark bar.\n\n- `<body>`: This tag represents the content of the web page.\n\n- `<div id=\"root\"></div>`: This div element serves as a placeholder for the root component of the web application. It is typically used by JavaScript frameworks like React to render the application.\n\n- `<script type=\"module\" src=\"/src/main.tsx\"></script>`: This script tag imports and executes a JavaScript module located at \"/src/main.tsx\". The \"type\" attribute specifies that the script is a module, which allows the use of modern JavaScript features like ES6 modules.\n\nIn the larger project, this HTML file would be served to the client's browser when they access the web application. The JavaScript module referenced in the script tag would then be responsible for rendering the application and handling user interactions.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\nThe code appears to be an HTML file that serves as the entry point for a web application. It includes a title, a base href, a viewport meta tag, and a script tag that references a TypeScript file.\n\n2. **What is the significance of the \"root\" div?**\nThe \"root\" div is likely the container element where the web application will be rendered. It is empty in this code, suggesting that the application's content will be dynamically generated and inserted into this div.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the \"main.tsx\" file?**\nThe \"main.tsx\" file is a TypeScript file that is being imported as a module. It is likely the main entry point for the web application's JavaScript logic.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/react-real-world-pokemons/index.md"}}],["12",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/react-real-world-pokemons/project.json)\n\nThe code provided is a configuration file for a project called \"showcase-react-real-world-pokemons\" within the larger \"farfetched\" project. This configuration file is used to define various targets and options for building, serving, linting, and previewing the project.\n\nThe `build` target specifies the executor as \"@nrwl/vite:build\" and sets the output path to \"dist/apps/showcase/react-real-world-pokemons\". This target is responsible for building the project and generating the output files.\n\nThe `serve` target uses the \"@nrwl/vite:dev-server\" executor and specifies the build target as \"showcase-react-real-world-pokemons:build\". This target is used to start a development server and serve the built project.\n\nThe `lint` target utilizes the \"@nrwl/linter:eslint\" executor and defines the lint file patterns as \"apps/showcase/react-real-world-pokemons/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}\". This target is responsible for running ESLint on the specified file patterns and producing linting outputs.\n\nThe `preview` target uses the \"@nrwl/vite:preview-server\" executor and sets the default configuration to \"development\". It also specifies the build target as \"showcase-react-real-world-pokemons:build\". Additionally, it defines two configurations: \"development\" and \"production\", each with their respective build targets.

It also imports the `Menu` component from the `features/layout` module, and the `MainPage` and `PokemonPage` components from the `pages` module.\n\nThe `createBrowserRouter` function is then called with an array of route objects as its argument. Each route object represents a specific route in the application and contains properties such as `path` and `element`. The `path` property specifies the URL path for the route, and the `element` property specifies the component to render when that route is accessed.\n\nIn this case, the root route `'/'` is defined with an `element` that consists of the `Menu` component and the `Outlet` component. The `Menu` component is responsible for rendering the navigation menu, while the `Outlet` component is a placeholder for the content that will be rendered based on the current route.\n\nThe root route also has three child routes defined within the `children` property. These child routes represent different paths within the root route. The first child route has a `path` of `'/'` and an `element` of `<MainPage />`, which means that when the root route is accessed, the `MainPage` component will be rendered. The second child route has a `path` of `'/pokemons/:page'` and an `element` of `<MainPage />`, which means that when a URL matching this pattern is accessed, the `MainPage` component will be rendered. The third child route has a `path` of `'/pokemon/:id'` and an `element` of `<PokemonPage />`, which means that when a URL matching this pattern is accessed, the `PokemonPage` component will be rendered.\n\nFinally, the `createBrowserRouter` function returns a `router` object, which is then passed as a prop to the `RouterProvider` component. The `RouterProvider` component is responsible for providing the routing functionality to the rest of the application.\n\nThe `App` function is defined as a functional component that returns the `RouterProvider` component with the `router` prop set to the `router` object returned by `createBrowserRouter`.\n\nOverall, this code sets up the routing configuration for the farfetched project, allowing different components to be rendered based on the current URL path.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It takes an array of route configurations as an argument and returns a router object.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `RouterProvider` component and how is it used?\n- The `RouterProvider` component is used to provide the router object to the application. It takes the `router` object as a prop and makes it available to all components in the application.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Outlet` component and how is it used?\n- The `Outlet` component is used to render the content of the current route.

These functions are used to generate URLs for making API requests to the PokeAPI.\n\nThe `pokemonUrl` function has two overloaded signatures. The first signature takes no parameters and returns a string representing the base URL for retrieving Pokemon data from the PokeAPI. The second signature takes an object parameter with an `id` property of type `TId` (which is imported from the `../../shared/id` module) and returns a string representing the URL for retrieving data of a specific Pokemon with the given ID.\n\nHere's an example of how the `pokemonUrl` function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { pokemonUrl } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst baseUrl = pokemonUrl(); // returns 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon'\nconst specificUrl = pokemonUrl({ id: 25 }); // returns 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/25'\n```\n\nSimilarly, the `speciesUrl` function also has two overloaded signatures. The first signature takes no parameters and returns a string representing the base URL for retrieving Pokemon species data from the PokeAPI. The second signature takes an object parameter with an `id` property of type `TId` and returns a string representing the URL for retrieving data of a specific Pokemon species with the given ID.\n\nHere's an example of how the `speciesUrl` function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { speciesUrl } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst baseUrl = speciesUrl(); // returns 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species'\nconst specificUrl = speciesUrl({ id: 25 }); // returns 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/25'\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to generate the URLs needed to make API requests to the PokeAPI for retrieving Pokemon and Pokemon species data. It abstracts away the construction of the URLs and allows the user to easily generate the appropriate URL based on their needs.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `TId` import from `'../../shared/id'`?\n- The smart developer might want to know what type of data the `TId` represents and how it is used in the code.\n\n2. What is the difference between the `pokemonUrl` and `speciesUrl` functions?\n- The smart developer might want to understand the distinction between these two functions and why they have separate implementations.\n\n3.

These record types are used to represent data structures for Pokemon and Species objects in the larger project.\n\nThe `Pokemon` record type has the following fields:\n- `id`: Represents the unique identifier of the Pokemon. It is of type `Id`.\n- `name`: Represents the name of the Pokemon. It is of type `String`.\n- `height`: Represents the height of the Pokemon. It is of type `Number`.\n- `weight`: Represents the weight of the Pokemon. It is of type `Number`.\n- `sprites`: Represents the sprites (images) of the Pokemon. It is a nested record with a single field `front_default` of type `Url`.\n- `species`: Represents the species of the Pokemon. It is of type `EntityLink`.\n\nThe `Species` record type has the following fields:\n- `id`: Represents the unique identifier of the species. It is of type `Id`.\n- `name`: Represents the name of the species. It is of type `String`.\n- `color`: Represents the color of the species. It is of type `EntityLink`.\n- `generation`: Represents the generation of the species. It is of type `EntityLink`.\n\nThese record types are defined using the `Record` function from the `runtypes` library. The `Record` function allows for the creation of runtime type validators for JavaScript objects. It ensures that the objects conform to a specific structure defined by the record type.\n\nThe `Pokemon` and `Species` record types can be used in the larger project to define and validate Pokemon and Species objects. For example, the `Pokemon` record type can be used to validate an incoming API response that represents a Pokemon object. If the response does not match the expected structure defined by the `Pokemon` record type, an error will be thrown.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `Pokemon` record type:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Pokemon } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst pokemonData = {\n  id: 1,\n  name: 'Bulbasaur',\n  height: 7,\n  weight: 69,\n  sprites: {\n    front_default: 'https://example.com/bulbasaur.png',\n  },\n  species: {\n    id: 1,\n    name: 'bulbasaur',\n    color: 'green',\n    generation: 'generation-1',\n  },\n};\n\nconst validatedPokemon = Pokemon.check(pokemonData);\nconsole.log(validatedPokemon);\n```\n\nIn this example, the `pokemonData` object is validated against the `Pokemon` record type using the `check` method. If the object matches the expected structure, it will be returned as is. Otherwise, an error will be thrown. The validated Pokemon object can then be used in the rest of the project with confidence in its structure and data types.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `runtypes` library and how is it used in this code?\n- The `runtypes` library is imported at the beginning of the code. A smart developer might wonder what functionality this library provides and how it is utilized in the code.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `EntityLink` type and how is it used in the `Pokemon` and `Species` records?\n- A smart developer might question the purpose and structure of the `EntityLink` type, as it is used as a property in both the `Pokemon` and `Species` records.\n\n3. What other files or modules are being imported in this code?\n- A smart developer might want to know what other files or modules are being imported in this code, as it could provide additional context and understanding of the overall project structure.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/react-real-world-pokemons/src/entities/pokemon/contract.md"}}],["16",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/react-real-world-pokemons/src/entities/pokemon/index.ts)\n\nThe code provided is exporting two modules, `Pokemon` and `Species`, from the `contract` file, and two modules, `pokemonUrl` and `speciesUrl`, from the `api` file. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to make these modules available for use in other parts of the project. By exporting these modules, they can be imported and used in other files within the project.\n\nThe `Pokemon` and `Species` modules are likely related to the data structure and functionality of Pokemon and species information. These modules may contain classes, functions, or variables that define the properties and behavior of Pokemon and species objects. For example, the `Pokemon` module may define a `Pokemon` class with methods for retrieving and manipulating Pokemon data, while the `Species` module may define a `Species` class with methods for retrieving and manipulating species data.\n\nThe `pokemonUrl` and `speciesUrl` modules are likely related to the URLs or endpoints used to fetch Pokemon and species data from an external API. These modules may contain variables or functions that define the URLs or endpoints for retrieving Pokemon and species data. For example, the `pokemonUrl` module may define a `pokemonUrl` variable that stores the URL for fetching Pokemon data, while the `speciesUrl` module may define a `speciesUrl` variable that stores the URL for fetching species data.\n\nBy exporting these modules, other parts of the project can import and use them as needed. For example, a file that needs to work with Pokemon data can import the `Pokemon` module and use its methods to retrieve and manipulate Pokemon data. Similarly, a file that needs to fetch species data can import the `speciesUrl` module and use its variables to construct the appropriate API request.\n\nOverall, this code plays a crucial role in making the `Pokemon`, `Species`, `pokemonUrl`, and `speciesUrl` modules available for use throughout the larger project. It allows other files to import and utilize these modules to work with Pokemon and species data and interact with the external API.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `contract` file?**\nThe `contract` file likely contains the definitions and interfaces for the `Pokemon` and `Species` classes, but it would be helpful to confirm this assumption.\n\n2. **What functionality does the `api` file provide?**\nThe `api` file likely contains functions or methods related to making API requests, but it would be beneficial to know the specific functionality it provides.\n\n3. **How are the exported variables used in the project?**\nIt would be useful to understand how the exported variables `Pokemon`, `Species`, `pokemonUrl`, and `speciesUrl` are used within the project and how they relate to each other.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/react-real-world-pokemons/src/entities/pokemon/index.md"}}],["17",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/react-real-world-pokemons/src/features/layout/index.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a module export statement that exports the `Menu` class from a file located at `./menu`. This code is part of the larger farfetched project and is used to make the `Menu` class accessible to other parts of the project.\n\nThe `Menu` class is likely a component or module that handles the rendering and functionality of a menu in the farfetched project. It may contain methods and properties related to menu items, navigation, and user interactions.\n\nBy exporting the `Menu` class, other files within the farfetched project can import and use this class. For example, if there is a file called `app.js` that needs to use the `Menu` class, it can import it using the following code:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Menu } from 'farfetched';\n```\n\nOnce imported, the `Menu` class can be instantiated and used within the `app.js` file. This allows the `app.js` file to leverage the functionality provided by the `Menu` class, such as rendering the menu, handling user interactions, and updating the state of the menu.\n\nThis code follows the module system in JavaScript, which allows for better organization and separation of concerns in a project. By exporting and importing modules, different parts of the project can be developed and maintained independently, making the codebase more modular and easier to understand and maintain.\n\nIn summary, the provided code exports the `Menu` class from a file located at `./menu` in the farfetched project. This allows other parts of the project to import and use the `Menu` class, enabling them to leverage its functionality for rendering and managing a menu.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `Menu` component?**\nThe `Menu` component is being exported from the `menu` file, but it is not clear what functionality or UI it provides.\n\n2. **Are there any other components or functions being exported from the `menu` file?**\nThe code only shows the export of the `Menu` component, but it is possible that there are other exports from the `menu` file that are not shown.\n\n3. **What is the relationship between the `farfetched` project and the `Menu` component?**\nThe code is being exported from the `farfetched` project, but it is not clear how the `Menu` component fits into the overall project structure or functionality.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/react-real-world-pokemons/src/features/layout/index.md"}}],["18",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/react-real-world-pokemons/src/features/layout/menu.tsx)\n\nThe code provided is a React component called `Menu` that is responsible for rendering a menu item for the \"Pokemons\" page. It imports the `Link` component from the `react-router-dom` library, which is used to create links between different pages in a React application.\n\nThe `Menu` component is a functional component, indicated by the use of the `function` keyword. It returns JSX code enclosed in parentheses, which is a common pattern in React for returning multiple elements without a wrapper element.\n\nInside the JSX code, there is a `Link` component that is used to create a link to the root path (\"/\") of the application. The text \"Pokemons\" is displayed as the content of the link. When this link is clicked, it will navigate the user to the \"Pokemons\" page.\n\nThis `Menu` component can be used in the larger project to display a navigation menu that allows users to navigate to different pages within the application. By using the `Link` component from `react-router-dom`, the navigation is handled efficiently without causing a full page reload.\n\nHere is an example of how the `Menu` component can be used in a larger project:\n\n```jsx\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n      <Menu />\n      <Switch>\n        <Route exact path=\"/\">\n          <PokemonsPage />\n        </Route>\n        <Route path=\"/other-page\">\n          <OtherPage />\n        </Route>\n      </Switch>\n    </Router>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Menu` component is rendered at the top of the `App` component, and it will always be visible on every page. The `Switch` component from `react-router-dom` is used to define the different routes of the application. When the user navigates to the root path (\"/\"), the `PokemonsPage` component will be rendered.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this code is to generate a set of links that allow the user to navigate between different pages of content.\n\nThe `Pagination` component takes in three props: `currentPage`, `totalPages`, and `pathname`. \n\n- `currentPage` represents the current page that the user is on.\n- `totalPages` represents the total number of pages available.\n- `pathname` represents the base URL path for the pagination links.\n\nThe `Pagination` component first generates an array of numbers using the `allInRange` function. This function takes in a starting number (`from`) and an ending number (`to`) and returns an array of numbers from `from` to `to`. This array is used to generate the individual page links.\n\nThe component then determines whether there is a previous page (`hasPrev`) and a next page (`hasNext`) based on the current page and the total number of pages.\n\nThe component then renders the pagination links using the `Link` component from the `react-router-dom` library. The links are rendered using the `map` function on the `pages` array. If the current page matches the current iteration of the `map` function, a `span` element is rendered with the page number. Otherwise, a `Link` element is rendered with the page number as the text and the appropriate URL path.\n\nFinally, the component renders the previous and next links if they exist.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `Pagination` component:\n\n```jsx\n<Pagination currentPage={2} totalPages={5} pathname=\"/posts\" />\n```\n\nThis would render a pagination system with links to the previous page, the individual page numbers, and the next page.

It imports the `createRoot` function from the `react-dom/client` module and the `App` component from a local file called `app.js`. \n\nThe `createRoot` function is a part of the React library and is used to create a root component that will be rendered into the DOM. It takes an argument, which is the DOM element where the root component will be rendered. In this case, it uses the `document.getElementById('root')` method to select the DOM element with the id 'root'. This element is typically a `<div>` element in the HTML file where the React application will be mounted.\n\nThe `App` component is a custom component defined in the `app.js` file. It is likely the main component of the application, which contains the structure and logic of the entire application. The `App` component is rendered inside the root component created by the `createRoot` function.\n\nThe `render` method is called on the root component to actually render the `App` component into the DOM. The `render` method is a part of the root component and is responsible for rendering the component tree into the selected DOM element. In this case, it renders the `App` component.\n\nThis code is typically the starting point of a React application. It sets up the root component and renders the main application component into the DOM. The `App` component can then contain other components and handle the application's logic and state.

This means that other files in the project can import and use the `MainPage` component by referencing its name.\n\nThe `MainPage` component is likely a key component in the farfetched project, representing the main page or a significant part of the user interface. It may contain various elements, such as navigation menus, content sections, and interactive components.\n\nBy exporting the `MainPage` component, other files in the project can import it and use it in their own components or modules. This promotes code reusability and modularity, as the `MainPage` component can be easily integrated into different parts of the project.\n\nHere is an example of how the `MainPage` component can be imported and used in another file:\n\n```javascript\nimport { MainPage } from 'farfetched';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <MainPage />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MainPage` component is imported from the `farfetched` module and rendered within the `App` component.

It imports functions like `createJsonQuery` and `declareParams` from the `@farfetched/core` library, `runtypeContract` from the `@farfetched/runtypes` library, and modules like `Array`, `Number`, and `Record` from the `runtypes` library. It also imports functions like `createGate`, `combine`, `createStore`, `sample`, and `createJsonQuery` from the `effector` library. Additionally, it imports the `pokemonUrl` function from the `../../entities/pokemon` file and the `urlToId` function from the `../../shared/id` file. Lastly, it imports the `EntityLink` component from the `../../shared/entity_link` file.\n\nThe code defines a gate called `MainPageGate` which takes an object with a `page` property as its parameter. It also creates a store called `$perPage` with an initial value of 20.\n\nThe code then defines a `pokemonListQuery` using the `createJsonQuery` function. This query specifies the parameters, request details, and response handling for fetching the Pokémon data. The request is a GET request to the `pokemonUrl()` with a query parameter called `source` which is a combination of the `limit` value from the `$perPage` store. The response is expected to be a JSON object with a `count` property of type `Number` and a `results` property of type `Array(EntityLink)`. The `mapData` function is used to transform the response data by adding an `id` property to each result object using the `urlToId` function.\n\nThe code then defines two derived stores: `$pokemonList` and `$totalPages`. `$pokemonList` maps the `results` property from the `pokemonListQuery.$data` store, returning an empty array if the response is null. `$totalPages` calculates the total number of pages based on the `count` property from the `pokemonListQuery.$data` store and the `perPage` value from the `$perPage` store.\n\nLastly, the code sets up a sample using the `sample` function. This sample triggers the `pokemonListQuery.start` event whenever the `MainPageGate.state` changes.\n\nOverall, this code sets up a query to fetch Pokémon data, transforms the response, and provides derived stores for the list of Pokémon, the total number of pages, and the pending state of the query.

The purpose of this component is to display a main page that shows a list of Pokemon and provides pagination functionality.\n\nThe component imports several functions and components from external libraries and files. It imports `useGate`, `useList`, and `useUnit` from the `effector-react` library, which are used for managing state and side effects in the component. It also imports `useParams` and `Link` from the `react-router-dom` library, which are used for handling URL parameters and creating links.\n\nThe component also imports the `Pagination` component from a file located at `../../features/pagination`, as well as several variables and functions from a file located at `./model`. These imported variables and functions include `$pending`, `$pokemonList`, `$totalPages`, and `MainPageGate`.\n\nThe component starts by using the `useParams` hook to get the current page number from the URL parameters. It then uses the `useGate` function to activate the `MainPageGate` with the current page number as a parameter. This gate is responsible for fetching the necessary data for the main page.\n\nNext, the component uses the `useUnit` function to subscribe to the `$totalPages` and `$pending` stores. This allows the component to access the current values of these stores and re-render whenever they change.\n\nThe component then uses the `useList` function to iterate over the `$pokemonList` store and render a list of Pokemon. Each Pokemon is rendered as a list item with a link to its individual page. The `useList` function takes a callback function that defines how each item in the list should be rendered.\n\nFinally, the component renders the main page content. It displays a heading with the text \"Main page\". If the data is not pending, it renders the list of Pokemon. If the data is pending, it displays a loading message. It also renders the `Pagination` component if the `totalPages` variable is truthy. The `Pagination` component is passed the current page number, the total number of pages, and the pathname for the links.\n\nIn summary, this code is a React component that displays a main page for the `farfetched` project. It fetches data for the page based on the current URL parameters, renders a list of Pokemon, and provides pagination functionality.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This data structure represents a link to an entity and consists of two properties: `name` and `url`.\n\nThe `EntityLink` data structure is defined as a record with two fields: `name` and `url`. The `name` field is of type `String`, which represents a string value, and the `url` field is of type `Url`, which is imported from the `url` module.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way of representing links to entities within the larger project. By using the `EntityLink` data structure, developers can ensure that all links to entities have the same structure and adhere to the defined types.\n\nThis code can be used in various parts of the project where links to entities need to be represented.

This creates a new runtype that represents a number with a specific brand, in this case, 'Id'. The `Id` constant is then assigned the runtype.\n\nAfter that, a type alias `TId` is defined using the `Static` utility type from the `runtypes` library. This type alias represents the static type of the `Id` runtype.\n\nThe code then defines a function `urlToId` that takes a parameter `url` of type `TUrl` and returns a value of type `TId`. The function implementation uses the `split` method on the `url` string to split it into an array of substrings using '/' as the delimiter. The `filter` method is then used to remove any empty strings from the array. Finally, the `at` method is used to access the last element of the array, and the `parseInt` function is used to convert it into a number. The result is then casted to type `TId` using the `as` keyword.\n\nFinally, the `urlToId` function, `Id` constant, and `TId` type alias are exported from the module, making them available for use in other parts of the farfetched project.\n\nThis module can be used in the larger farfetched project to extract an ID value from a URL string. Here's an example of how it can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { urlToId } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst url = 'https://example.com/api/users/123';\nconst id = urlToId(url);\nconsole.log(id); // Output: 123\n```\n\nIn this example, the `urlToId` function is called with a URL string, and it returns the ID value extracted from the URL.

The `Static` type is used to create a new type based on the provided runtype, while the `String` type represents a string value. \n\nThe code then defines a new type called `Url` using the `String.withBrand` method. The `withBrand` method is a function provided by the 'runtypes' library that allows for the creation of a new type with a specific brand. In this case, the brand is set to 'URL', indicating that the `Url` type represents a URL string. \n\nNext, the code creates a type alias `TUrl` using the `Static<typeof Url>` syntax. This type alias represents the static type of the `Url` type. The `Static` type is a utility type provided by the 'runtypes' library that extracts the static type of a runtype. \n\nFinally, the code exports both the `Url` type and the `TUrl` type alias for use in other parts of the project. \n\nThis code is likely part of a larger project that requires the use of URL strings. By defining the `Url` type with a brand and exporting it, other modules in the project can import and use this type to ensure that URL strings are used correctly and consistently throughout the project. \n\nFor example, a module that handles API requests may import the `Url` type and use it to validate and enforce the use of valid URL strings when making requests. \n\n```typescript\nimport { Url } from 'farfetched';\n\nfunction makeRequest(url: Url) {\n  // code to make API request using the provided URL\n}\n\nconst apiUrl = 'https://api.example.com';\nmakeRequest(apiUrl); // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Url'\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `makeRequest` function expects a parameter of type `Url`, which ensures that only valid URL strings are passed to the function. If a regular string is passed instead, TypeScript will throw a type error. This helps catch potential bugs and ensures that the project consistently uses valid URL strings.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `Outlet` component is a placeholder for the content that will be rendered based on the current route. The routes are defined as an array of objects, each representing a route with a `path` and an `element`. The `path` is the URL path for the route, and the `element` is the component to render when that route is accessed.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/react-real-world-pokemons/summary.md"}}],["33",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/react-real-world-pokemons/tsconfig.json)\n\nThe code provided is a configuration file written in JSON format. It is used to configure the TypeScript compiler for the farfetched project. The configuration file is named `tsconfig.json` and is located in the `farfetched` directory.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to specify the compiler options and settings for the TypeScript compiler. These options define how the TypeScript code will be compiled into JavaScript. Let's go through the different sections of the code to understand its purpose:\n\n1. `\"extends\": \"../../../tsconfig.base.json\"`: This line specifies that the configuration should extend the settings defined in the `tsconfig.base.json` file located two directories above the current directory. This allows for reusing common settings across multiple projects.\n\n2. `\"compilerOptions\": { ... }`: This section contains various options that configure the behavior of the TypeScript compiler. Some notable options include:\n   - `\"target\": \"ESNext\"`: Specifies that the output JavaScript should be compatible with the ECMAScript version ESNext, which represents the latest version of JavaScript.\n   - `\"module\": \"ESNext\"`: Specifies that the module system used in the project is ESNext, which supports modern JavaScript module syntax.\n   - `\"strict\": true`: Enables strict type-checking and additional type inference rules to catch common errors.\n   - `\"resolveJsonModule\": true`: Allows importing JSON files as modules in TypeScript.\n   - `\"lib\": [\"DOM\", \"DOM.Iterable\", \"ESNext\"]`: Specifies the libraries that are available to the project. In this case, it includes the DOM and DOM.Iterable libraries, which provide typings for working with the Document Object Model, and the ESNext library for modern JavaScript features.\n\n3. `\"include\": [\"**/*.js\", \"**/*.jsx\", \"**/*.ts\", \"**/*.tsx\", \"src\"]`: This line specifies the files and directories that should be included in the compilation process. It includes all JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSX files in the project's source directory (`src`).\n\nBy providing this configuration file, developers working on the farfetched project can ensure that their TypeScript code is compiled with the desired settings and options. This allows for better type-checking, compatibility with modern JavaScript features, and a more efficient development process.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `extends` property in the `tsconfig.json` file?**\nThe `extends` property is used to inherit compiler options from another configuration file.

In this case, the routes are being created with specific parameter types. \n\nThe `characterRoute` is created with a parameter type of `{ characterId: TId }`. This suggests that the route is meant to handle requests related to a specific character, with the `characterId` parameter representing the ID of the character. The `TId` type is likely a custom type defined in the `../../shared/id` module, which could be used to represent unique identifiers for various entities in the project.\n\nThe `characterListRoute` is created with a parameter type of `{ page?: number }`. This suggests that the route is meant to handle requests related to a list of characters, with the optional `page` parameter representing the page number of the character list. The `page` parameter is optional, indicated by the `?` symbol, meaning that it can be omitted when making requests to this route.\n\nThese routes can be used in the larger project to define the routing structure and handle incoming requests related to characters. For example, the `characterRoute` can be used to handle requests to view a specific character's details, while the `characterListRoute` can be used to handle requests to view a list of characters, with pagination support.\n\nHere is an example of how these routes could be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { characterRoute, characterListRoute } from 'farfetched';\n\n// Handle request to view a specific character\napp.get('/characters/:characterId', (req, res) => {\n  const { characterId } = req.params;\n  // Use the characterRoute to handle the request\n  characterRoute.handle({ characterId })\n    .then((result) => {\n      res.send(result);\n    })\n    .catch((error) => {\n      res.status(500).send(error);\n    });\n});\n\n// Handle request to view a list of characters\napp.get('/characters', (req, res) => {\n  const { page } = req.query;\n  // Use the characterListRoute to handle the request\n  characterListRoute.handle({ page: Number(page) })\n    .then((result) => {\n      res.send(result);\n    })\n    .catch((error) => {\n      res.status(500).send(error);\n    });\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the `characterRoute` and `characterListRoute` are used to handle incoming requests to view specific characters and character lists, respectively. The route parameters are extracted from the request (`req.params` and `req.query`) and passed to the corresponding route's `handle` method. The result of the route handling is then sent back as the response.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `createRoute` function from the 'atomic-router' module?**\nThe `createRoute` function is used to create a route object that represents a specific route in the application.

In this code, the `params` property is an object with a single property `id` of type `TId` for the `characterQuery` function, `ids` of type `TId[]` for the `characterListQuery` function, and `page` of type `number` for the `characterPageQuery` function.\n\nThe `request` property is an object that defines the URL, method, and query parameters for the API request. The URL is generated using the `characterUrl` function from the `./api` module. The method is set to 'GET' for all three functions. The `query` property is only used in the `characterPageQuery` function and it generates the query parameters for the API request based on the `page` parameter.\n\nThe `response` property is an object that defines the contract for the API response. It uses the `runtypeContract` function from the `@farfetched/runtypes` module to define the contract. The contract specifies the expected structure of the response data. For the `characterQuery` function, the response is expected to be of type `Character`. For the `characterListQuery` function, the response is expected to be an array of `Character`. For the `characterPageQuery` function, the response is expected to be an object with properties `info` of type `Info` and `results` which is an array of `Character`.\n\nThese functions can be used in the larger project to make API requests for character data. The `characterQuery` function can be used to retrieve data for a single character by providing the `id` parameter. The `characterListQuery` function can be used to retrieve data for multiple characters by providing an array of `ids`. The `characterPageQuery` function can be used to retrieve data for a specific page of characters by providing the `page` parameter.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nconst characterData = await characterQuery({ id: 1 });\nconsole.log(characterData);\n\nconst characterListData = await characterListQuery({ ids: [1, 2, 3] });\nconsole.log(characterListData);\n\nconst characterPageData = await characterPageQuery({ page: 1 });\nconsole.log(characterPageData);\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `characterQuery` function is used to retrieve data for a character with `id` 1. The `characterListQuery` function is used to retrieve data for characters with `ids` 1, 2, and 3. The `characterPageQuery` function is used to retrieve data for the first page of characters. The retrieved data is then logged to the console.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `createJsonQuery` function?**\nThe `createJsonQuery` function is used to create a JSON query object that defines the parameters, request details, and response contract for making API requests.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `declareParams` function?**\nThe `declareParams` function is used to declare the types and structure of the parameters that can be passed to the API requests. It ensures that the parameters are of the correct type and structure.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `runtypeContract` function?**\nThe `runtypeContract` function is used to define the contract or schema for the response data. It specifies the expected structure and types of the response data, allowing for validation and type checking.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/entities/character/query.md"}}],["43",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/entities/episode/api.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a TypeScript function called `episodeUrl` that is used to generate URLs for retrieving episodes from the Rick and Morty API. The function has three overloaded signatures and a default implementation.\n\nThe first signature `function episodeUrl(): string;` is a zero-argument version of the function that returns a string representing the URL for retrieving all episodes from the API.\n\nThe second signature `function episodeUrl({ id }: { id: TId }): string;` is a version of the function that takes an object with a single property `id` of type `TId`. It returns a string representing the URL for retrieving a specific episode with the given `id` from the API.\n\nThe third signature `function episodeUrl({ ids }: { ids: TId[] }): string;` is a version of the function that takes an object with a single property `ids` of type `TId[]` (an array of `TId`). It returns a string representing the URL for retrieving multiple episodes with the given `ids` from the API.\n\nThe default implementation of the function `function episodeUrl(params?: { id?: TId; ids?: TId[] })` handles the logic for generating the URLs based on the provided parameters. It first checks if the `ids` property exists in the `params` object. If it does, it generates a URL that includes all the `ids` in the format `https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/[id1,id2,id3,...]`. If the `id` property exists in the `params` object, it generates a URL for a single episode using the `id` value. If neither `ids` nor `id` is provided, it returns the URL for retrieving all episodes.\n\nThe function is exported as `episodeUrl`, which means it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. Other modules can import this function and use it to generate the appropriate URL for retrieving episodes from the Rick and Morty API based on their specific requirements.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```typescript\nimport { episodeUrl } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst allEpisodesUrl = episodeUrl(); // Returns 'https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode'\n\nconst singleEpisodeUrl = episodeUrl({ id: 42 }); // Returns 'https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/42'\n\nconst multipleEpisodesUrl = episodeUrl({ ids: [1, 2, 3] }); // Returns 'https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/[1,2,3]'\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `TId` import from `'../../shared/id'`?\n- The `TId` import is likely used to define the type of the `id` parameter in the `episodeUrl` function.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the multiple function declarations with the same name but different parameter types?\n- The multiple function declarations with different parameter types allow for different ways of calling the `episodeUrl` function, depending on whether an `id` or an array of `ids` is provided.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `params` parameter and how is it used in the `episodeUrl` function?\n- The `params` parameter is an optional object that can contain either an `id` or an array of `ids`. It is used to construct the URL for the Rick and Morty API based on the provided parameters.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/entities/episode/api.md"}}],["44",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/entities/episode/contract.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a module that defines the structure of an \"Episode\" object. It uses the \"runtypes\" library to define the types of each property in the object.\n\nThe \"Episode\" object has the following properties:\n- \"id\": This property represents the unique identifier of the episode and is of type \"Id\". The \"Id\" type is imported from the \"../../shared/id\" module.\n- \"name\": This property represents the name of the episode and is of type \"String\".\n- \"air_date\": This property represents the air date of the episode and is of type \"String\".\n- \"episode\": This property represents the episode code or number and is of type \"String\".\n- \"characters\": This property represents an array of character URLs that are associated with the episode. Each URL is of type \"Url\". The \"Url\" type is imported from the \"../../shared/url\" module.\n\nThe module exports the \"Episode\" object, allowing other parts of the project to import and use it. This module can be used in the larger project to define and validate episode objects. For example, it can be used to ensure that any episode data received from an external API or user input conforms to the expected structure.\n\nHere's an example of how this module can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Episode } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst episodeData = {\n  id: '123',\n  name: 'The Pilot',\n  air_date: '2022-01-01',\n  episode: 'S01E01',\n  characters: [\n    'https://example.com/character/1',\n    'https://example.com/character/2',\n    'https://example.com/character/3',\n  ],\n};\n\n// Validate the episode data\nconst result = Episode.check(episodeData);\n\nif (result.success) {\n  console.log('Episode data is valid');\n} else {\n  console.error('Episode data is invalid:', result.message);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the \"Episode\" object is used to validate the \"episodeData\" object. The \"check\" method provided by the \"Episode\" object is called to validate the data. If the data is valid, a success message is logged. Otherwise, an error message is logged with details about the validation failure.\n## Questions: \n 1.

These exported functions and variables are likely used in the larger project to handle and retrieve data related to episodes.\n\nThe `model.js` file is responsible for defining and exporting two routes: `episodeRoute` and `episodeListRoute`. These routes are likely used to handle HTTP requests related to episodes. For example, `episodeRoute` could be used to handle requests for a specific episode, while `episodeListRoute` could be used to handle requests for a list of episodes. These routes may be implemented using a framework like Express.js, where each route is associated with a specific URL and HTTP method.\n\nThe `query.js` file is responsible for defining and exporting three functions: `episodeListQuery`, `episodePageQuery`, and `episodeQuery`. These functions are likely used to query a database or an API to retrieve episode data. For example, `episodeListQuery` could be used to retrieve a list of episodes from a database, `episodePageQuery` could be used to retrieve a specific page of episodes, and `episodeQuery` could be used to retrieve a specific episode. These functions may use a database query language like SQL or an API query language like GraphQL to retrieve the desired data.\n\nHere is an example of how these exported functions and variables could be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { episodeRoute, episodeListRoute } from 'farfetched';\n\n// Handle a request for a specific episode\napp.get('/episode/:id', episodeRoute);\n\n// Handle a request for a list of episodes\napp.get('/episodes', episodeListRoute);\n\nimport { episodeListQuery, episodePageQuery, episodeQuery } from 'farfetched';\n\n// Retrieve a list of episodes from the database\nconst episodes = episodeListQuery();\n\n// Retrieve the first page of episodes from the database\nconst page1 = episodePageQuery(1);\n\n// Retrieve a specific episode from the database\nconst episode = episodeQuery(123);\n```\n\nOverall, this code is responsible for exporting functions and variables related to handling and retrieving episode data in the larger project.

It then uses the `createRoute` function to create two route objects: `episodeRoute` and `episodeListRoute`. These route objects are then exported for use in other parts of the project.\n\nThe `createRoute` function is likely a utility function provided by the `atomic-router` module that simplifies the process of creating route objects. Route objects are commonly used in web applications to define the different paths or URLs that the application can handle. They typically contain information about the route's path, any parameters or query strings it expects, and any additional metadata.\n\nIn this specific case, the `episodeRoute` object is created with a parameter `episodeId` of type `TId`. This suggests that this route is used to handle requests related to a specific episode, where the `episodeId` parameter represents the unique identifier of the episode. For example, a request to `/episode/123` would match this route, with `123` being the `episodeId` parameter.\n\nThe `episodeListRoute` object, on the other hand, is created with an optional `page` parameter of type `number`. This suggests that this route is used to handle requests for a list of episodes, where the `page` parameter represents the page number of the list. For example, a request to `/episodes?page=2` would match this route, with `2` being the `page` parameter.\n\nBy exporting these route objects, other parts of the project can import and use them to define the routing behavior of the application. For example, a router module could import these route objects and use them to map incoming requests to the appropriate handlers or components.\n\nOverall, this code is responsible for creating and exporting two route objects that define the routing behavior for handling requests related to individual episodes and lists of episodes in the larger project.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `createRoute` function from the 'atomic-router' module?**\nThe `createRoute` function is used to create a route object that represents a specific route in the application.

These functions are used to create JSON queries for retrieving information about episodes.\n\nThe `createJsonQuery` function is imported from the `@farfetched/core` module and is used to create a JSON query object. It takes an object as an argument with the following properties:\n- `params`: This property is used to declare the parameters required for the query. In this code, the `declareParams` function is used to declare the parameters. The `episodeQuery` function requires a single parameter `id` of type `TId`, the `episodeListQuery` function requires a parameter `ids` which is an array of `TId`, and the `episodePageQuery` function requires a parameter `page` of type `number`.\n- `request`: This property is used to define the request details for the query. It includes the URL, method, and query parameters if applicable. The URL is generated using the `episodeUrl` function from the `./api` module. The method is set to 'GET' for all three functions. The `episodePageQuery` function also includes a query parameter `page` which is generated based on the `page` parameter.\n- `response`: This property is used to define the expected response structure for the query. It includes the contract for the response data. The `runtypeContract` function from the `@farfetched/runtypes` module is used to define the contract. The `episodeQuery` function expects a response of type `Episode`, the `episodeListQuery` function expects a response of type `Array(Episode)`, and the `episodePageQuery` function expects a response of type `Record({ info: Info, results: Array(Episode) })`.\n\nThese functions can be used in the larger project to make API requests for retrieving episode information. For example, the `episodeQuery` function can be used to retrieve information about a specific episode by providing the episode ID as a parameter. The `episodeListQuery` function can be used to retrieve information about multiple episodes by providing an array of episode IDs as a parameter. The `episodePageQuery` function can be used to retrieve a page of episodes by providing the page number as a parameter.\n\nHere are some examples of how these functions can be used:\n\n```javascript\nconst episodeInfo = await episodeQuery({ id: '123' });\nconsole.log(episodeInfo);\n\nconst episodeList = await episodeListQuery({ ids: ['123', '456', '789'] });\nconsole.log(episodeList);\n\nconst episodePage = await episodePageQuery({ page: 1 });\nconsole.log(episodePage);\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to create JSON queries for retrieving episode information in the farfetched project.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `createJsonQuery` function?**\nThe `createJsonQuery` function is used to create a JSON query object that defines the parameters, request details, and response contract for making API requests.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `runtypeContract` function?**\nThe `runtypeContract` function is used to create a contract that defines the expected structure and types of the response data from an API request.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `declareParams` function?**\nThe `declareParams` function is used to declare the expected parameters for an API request, such as `id`, `ids`, or `page`, and their corresponding types.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/entities/episode/query.md"}}],["48",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/entities/location/api.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a TypeScript function called `locationUrl` that is used to generate URLs for the Rick and Morty API's location endpoint. The function has three different overloads, each with a different set of parameters.\n\nThe first overload is a function signature without any parameters, which returns a string representing the base URL for the location endpoint: `https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location`. This is the default behavior when no parameters are provided.\n\nThe second overload is a function signature that expects an object with a property `id` of type `TId`. It returns a string representing the URL for a specific location with the given `id`. The `id` is interpolated into the URL: `https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location/${params.id}`.\n\nThe third overload is a function signature that expects an object with a property `ids` of type `TId[]`. It returns a string representing the URL for multiple locations with the given `ids`. The `ids` are joined with commas and interpolated into the URL: `https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location/[${params.ids.join(',')}]`.\n\nThe function uses optional chaining (`params?.ids` and `params?.id`) to check if the `ids` or `id` properties exist before accessing them. If `ids` is present, it generates a URL for multiple locations. If `id` is present, it generates a URL for a single location. If neither `ids` nor `id` is present, it falls back to the default URL for all locations.\n\nThis function can be used in the larger project to easily generate URLs for the location endpoint of the Rick and Morty API. Developers can use this function to fetch data for specific locations or multiple locations by providing the appropriate parameters. Here are some examples of how this function can be used:\n\n```typescript\nconst url1 = locationUrl(); // returns \"https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location\"\n\nconst url2 = locationUrl({ id: 1 }); // returns \"https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location/1\"\n\nconst url3 = locationUrl({ ids: [1, 2, 3] }); // returns \"https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location/[1,2,3]\"\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

This module is part of a larger project called farfetched.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to define the structure and type validation for a Location object. The Location object represents a location in the farfetched project and contains properties such as id, name, type, dimension, and residents.\n\nThe code uses the Runtype library to define the structure of the Location object. Runtype is a library that provides runtime type checking and validation for JavaScript and TypeScript. It allows developers to define complex data structures with type constraints and perform runtime validation on those structures.\n\nThe Location object is defined using the `Record` function from the Runtype library. The `Record` function takes an object literal as an argument, where each property of the object represents a field in the Location object. The value of each property is a Runtype that defines the type and constraints for that field.\n\nIn this case, the Location object has the following fields:\n- id: An instance of the Id Runtype, which represents a unique identifier.\n- name: A string value.\n- type: A string value.\n- dimension: A string value.\n- residents: An array of Url values. The Url Runtype represents a URL string.\n\nHere is an example of how this code can be used in the larger farfetched project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Location } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst locationData = {\n  id: '123',\n  name: 'Earth',\n  type: 'Planet',\n  dimension: '3D',\n  residents: ['https://example.com/resident1', 'https://example.com/resident2'],\n};\n\nconst location = Location.check(locationData);\nconsole.log(location);\n```\n\nIn this example, we import the Location Runtype definition from the farfetched module. We then define a locationData object that matches the structure defined by the Location Runtype. We use the `check` method provided by Runtype to validate the locationData object against the Location Runtype. If the object passes the validation, it is assigned to the `location` variable. Finally, we log the `location` object to the console.\n\nBy using this code, the farfetched project can ensure that Location objects are properly structured and validated throughout the application, preventing potential bugs and errors caused by incorrect data types or missing fields.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `Id` and `Url` imports from the `../../shared` directory?**\nThe `Id` import is likely used to represent a unique identifier for a location, while the `Url` import is likely used to represent a URL associated with a location.\n\n2. **What is the `Location` constant used for?**\nThe `Location` constant is a Runtype record that defines the structure of a location object, including properties such as `id`, `name`, `type`, `dimension`, and `residents`.\n\n3. **What is the `runtypes` library used for and how is it being used in this code?**\nThe `runtypes` library is being used to define and enforce type constraints for the `Location` record.

It may include components, templates, or functions that handle rendering and updating location information on the user interface. \n\nThe `locationRoute` module is exported from a file called `model`. This module likely contains code related to routing and navigation within the application. It may include functions or classes that define the routes and handle the logic for navigating to different locations within the application. \n\nThe `locationQuery` module is exported from a file called `query`.

It may include functions or classes that interact with an API or database to fetch location information based on certain criteria or parameters. \n\nThese exported modules can be imported and used in other parts of the `farfetched` project. For example, if another module needs to display location details, it can import the `LocationDetails` module and use its components or functions. Similarly, if another module needs to define routes for location-related pages, it can import the `locationRoute` module and use its functions or classes.

Each route would have a unique `locationId` parameter that identifies the specific destination. \n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { locationRoute } from 'farfetched';\n\n// Define a route for a specific location\nconst routeToParis = locationRoute({ locationId: 'paris' });\n\n// Use the route to navigate to the location\nrouteToParis.navigate();\n```\n\nIn this example, the `locationRoute` function is used to create a route for the location with the `locationId` of `'paris'`. The resulting `routeToParis` object can then be used to navigate to the Paris location in the application.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What does the `createRoute` function do?**\nThe `createRoute` function is imported from the `atomic-router` module, but its functionality is not clear from the code snippet.

It is designed to be used in the larger project to fetch location information based on a given ID.\n\nThe code imports two functions, `createJsonQuery` and `declareParams`, from the `@farfetched/core` module. It also imports a function called `runtypeContract` from the `@farfetched/runtypes` module. Additionally, it imports the `TId` type from the `../../shared/id` module and the `locationUrl` function and `Location` type from the `./api` and `./contract` modules respectively.\n\nThe `locationQuery` function is defined using the `createJsonQuery` function. It takes an object as an argument with three properties: `params`, `request`, and `response`. \n\nThe `params` property is defined using the `declareParams` function and specifies that the `id` parameter should be of type `TId`.\n\nThe `request` property is an object that specifies the URL and method for the API request. The URL is determined by the `locationUrl` function, which takes the `id` parameter as an argument. The method is set to 'GET'.\n\nThe `response` property specifies the contract for the response data. It uses the `runtypeContract` function to define the contract as the `Location` type.\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to create a JSON query for fetching location data from an API. It abstracts away the details of constructing the query and handling the response, making it easier to use in the larger project. Here is an example of how the `locationQuery` function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nconst locationData = await locationQuery({ id: '123' });\nconsole.log(locationData);\n```\n\nIn this example, the `locationQuery` function is called with an object containing the `id` parameter. The function sends a GET request to the API using the specified URL and retrieves the location data. The data is then logged to the console.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `createJsonQuery` function and how does it work?\n- The `createJsonQuery` function is used to create a JSON query for making HTTP requests. It takes in an object with parameters, request details, and response details to define the query.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `declareParams` function and how is it used in this code?\n- The `declareParams` function is used to declare the parameters for the JSON query.

It takes in two props: `title` (a string) and `location` (an optional object that matches the shape of the `Location` contract).\n\nThe component is imported into another file as a named export using `import { LocationDetails } from 'farfetched'`.\n\nWhen rendering, the component checks if the `location` prop is truthy using the `<Show>` component from the `solid-js` library. If `location` is truthy, it renders the details of the location.\n\nThe details include the location's name, type, and dimension. These details are displayed in an HTML table with two rows: one for the type and one for the dimension. The location's name is displayed as the title of the section.\n\nAdditionally, there is a link rendered at the bottom of the section using the `Link` component from the `atomic-router-solid` library. The link is used to navigate to a specific route (`locationRoute`) with a parameter (`locationId`) set to the ID of the location.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that involves displaying and managing locations. It can be used to render a single location's details on a page, allowing users to view information about a specific location and navigate to more detailed information about that location.\n\nHere is an example of how the `LocationDetails` component can be used in a larger project:\n\n```jsx\nimport { LocationDetails } from 'farfetched';\n\nfunction LocationPage() {\n  const location = {\n    id: 1,\n    name: 'Earth',\n    type: 'Planet',\n    dimension: 'Dimension C-137',\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Location Details</h1>\n      <LocationDetails title=\"Location\" location={location} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `LocationDetails` component is used to display the details of the `location` object. The `title` prop is set to \"Location\" and the `location` prop is set to the `location` object. The component will render the location's details and the link to navigate to more information about the location.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This code is part of the larger farfetched project and is used to make the `Menu` class accessible to other parts of the project.\n\nThe `Menu` class is likely a component or module that handles the rendering and functionality of a menu in the farfetched project. It may contain methods and properties related to menu items, navigation, and user interactions.\n\nBy exporting the `Menu` class, other files in the project can import and use it. For example, if there is a file called `app.js` that needs to use the `Menu` class, it can import it using the following code:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Menu } from 'farfetched';\n```\n\nOnce imported, the `Menu` class can be instantiated and used within the `app.js` file. This allows the `app.js` file to leverage the functionality provided by the `Menu` class, such as rendering the menu, handling user interactions, and updating the state of the menu items.\n\n```javascript\nconst menu = new Menu();\nmenu.render();\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Menu` class is instantiated and its `render` method is called to display the menu on the screen.\n\nOverall, this code snippet is a crucial part of the farfetched project as it allows the `Menu` class to be shared and used across different files.

It imports the \"Link\" component from the \"atomic-router-solid\" library, as well as the \"characterListRoute\" and \"episodeListRoute\" variables from the \"character\" and \"episode\" modules respectively.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a reusable navigation menu that includes links to the \"Characters\" and \"Episodes\" pages of the application. The \"Link\" component is used to create clickable links that navigate to the specified routes.\n\nThe \"Menu\" component is a functional component, which means it is a simple JavaScript function that returns JSX (JavaScript XML) code. In this case, the JSX code represents the HTML structure of the navigation menu. The menu is wrapped in a `<nav>` element, and it contains two `<Link>` components. Each `<Link>` component represents a link in the menu, with the text \"Characters\" and \"Episodes\" respectively. The `to` prop of each `<Link>` component is set to the corresponding route variable, which determines the destination of the link.\n\nHere is an example of how this component can be used in a larger project:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Menu from './Menu';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Menu />\n      <h1>Welcome to Farfetched!</h1>\n      {/* Other components and content */}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn this example, the \"Menu\" component is imported and rendered within the \"App\" component. The navigation menu will be displayed at the top of the page, followed by the heading \"Welcome to Farfetched!\" and any other components or content specific to the application.\n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable navigation menu component that can be easily integrated into a larger React application. It promotes code reusability and maintainability by encapsulating the menu logic and structure in a separate component.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `atomic-router-solid` package and how does it relate to this code? \n- The `atomic-router-solid` package is being imported to use the `Link` component, which is used to create navigation links in the `Menu` component.\n\n2. What are `characterListRoute` and `episodeListRoute` and where are they defined? \n- `characterListRoute` and `episodeListRoute` are variables that are imported from the `character` and `episode` files located in the `entities` folder respectively. They likely contain the routes for the character and episode lists.\n\n3. How is the `Menu` component being used in the project? \n- The `Menu` component is likely being used to display a navigation menu in the project, with links to the character list and episode list pages.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/features/layout/menu.md"}}],["56",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/features/pagination.tsx)\n\nThe code provided is a React component called `Pagination` that is used to render a pagination component in a larger project. The purpose of this component is to display a set of page numbers and navigation links (previous and next) based on the current page and the total number of pages.\n\nThe `Pagination` component takes in three props: `currentPage`, `info`, and `route`. \n- `currentPage` is the current page number.\n- `info` is an object that contains information about the pagination, such as the total number of pages (`info.pages`), the previous page URL (`info.prev`), and the next page URL (`info.next`).\n- `route` is an instance of the `RouteInstance` class, which represents the current route.\n\nThe component uses the `Show` and `For` components from the `solid-js` library to conditionally render the pagination links and page numbers. \n\nThe `toParams` function is a helper function that takes a page number as input and returns an object with the page number as a parameter. If the page number is 1, an empty object is returned. This function is used to generate the `params` prop for the `Link` components.\n\nThe `hasNext`, `hasPrevious`, and `totalPages` functions are helper functions that check if there is a next page, a previous page, and return the total number of pages, respectively. These functions are used to conditionally render the previous and next navigation links.\n\nThe `allInRange` function is another helper function that takes a range of numbers (from and to) and returns an array of numbers within that range. This function is used in the `For` component to iterate over the page numbers and render the corresponding `Link` components.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `Pagination` component:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Pagination } from 'farfetched';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const currentPage = 3;\n  const info = {\n    pages: 5,\n    prev: '/page/2',\n    next: '/page/4',\n  };\n  const route = new RouteInstance({ page: currentPage });\n\n  return (\n    <Pagination currentPage={currentPage} info={info} route={route} />\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Pagination` component is rendered with the current page set to 3, the total number of pages set to 5, and the previous and next page URLs set accordingly. The `route` prop is created using the `RouteInstance` class with the current page as a parameter. The component will render the pagination links and page numbers based on these props.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `Pagination` component?**\nThe `Pagination` component is responsible for rendering pagination links based on the current page, information about the total number of pages, and the route instance.\n\n2. **What does the `toParams` function do?**\nThe `toParams` function takes a page number as input and returns an object with a `page` property if the page number is not equal to 1, otherwise it returns an empty object.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `allInRange` function?**\nThe `allInRange` function generates an array of numbers starting from the `from` value and ending at the `to` value, inclusive.

The purpose of this code is to render the `App` component onto the HTML page.\n\nFirst, the code imports the `render` function from the `solid-js/web` module. This function is responsible for rendering the application onto the DOM. \n\nNext, the `App` component is imported from the `./app` module. This component represents the main application logic and UI.\n\nThe `render` function is then called with two arguments. The first argument is an arrow function that returns the `App` component. This arrow function is a JSX expression, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows the creation of HTML-like elements in JavaScript code. The `App` component is wrapped in JSX syntax (`<App />`) to indicate that it should be rendered as a React-like component.\n\nThe second argument passed to the `render` function is the target DOM element where the application should be rendered. In this case, it is obtained by calling `document.getElementById('root')`. This assumes that there is an HTML element with the `id` attribute set to `'root'` in the HTML file. The `as HTMLElement` syntax is a type assertion to ensure that the returned value is treated as an `HTMLElement` type.\n\nOverall, this code sets up the entry point for the web application and renders the `App` component onto the specified DOM element. This code is typically placed in the main JavaScript file of the project and serves as the starting point for the application. It can be used in the larger project to bootstrap the application and define the initial UI structure.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `render` function and how does it work?\n- The `render` function is used to render the application component (`App`) to the DOM. It takes a callback function that returns the component to be rendered and the target element where it should be rendered.\n\n2. What is the role of the `App` component and where is it defined?\n- The `App` component is the main component of the application. It is defined in a file located at './app'.\n\n3.

The `currentCharacterQuery` is created using the `characterQuery` function. The `currentLocationQuery` and `originQuery` are both created using the `locationQuery` function, with the `mapParams` option provided to map the URL parameter to the required format. The `characterEpisodesQuery` is created using the `episodeListQuery` function, with the `mapParams` option provided to map the array of URLs to an array of IDs.\n\nAfter creating the queries, the code uses the `connectQuery` function to connect the `characterQuery` to the `originQuery`, `currentLocationQuery`, and `characterEpisodesQuery`. This is done by specifying the source query, a function that extracts the necessary parameters from the source query result, and the target query.\n\nFinally, the code uses the `sample` function to create a sample that triggers the `currentCharacterQuery` when the `characterRoute.opened` event occurs.

It also imports several queries and routes from other files within the project.\n\nThe `CharacterPage` component uses the `createQueryResource` function to create query resources for the `currentCharacterQuery`, `originQuery`, `currentLocationQuery`, and `characterEpisodesQuery`. These query resources are used to fetch data asynchronously and handle loading and error states.\n\nThe component renders its content within a `Suspense` component, which displays a fallback message while the data is being loaded.

The purpose of this component is to render the details of an episode and the characters in that episode.\n\nThe component imports several dependencies, including `createQueryResource` from the `@farfetched/solid` package, `Link` from the `atomic-router-solid` package, and `For`, `Show`, and `Suspense` from the `solid-js` package. These dependencies are used to handle data fetching, routing, and rendering in the component.\n\nThe `EpisodePage` component defines two query resources using the `createQueryResource` function. The first query resource, `episode`, is created using the `curentEpisodeQuery` function. The second query resource, `charactersInEpisode`, is created using the `charactersInEpisodeQuery` function.\n\nThe component then renders its content using JSX syntax. It starts with a `Suspense` component that displays a fallback message of \"Loading...\" while the data is being fetched. Inside the `Suspense` component, there is a `Show` component that conditionally renders the episode details when the `episode` query resource has data. The episode details, such as the name, episode number, and air date, are rendered using the data from the `episode` query resource.\n\nNext, there is another `Suspense` component that displays a fallback message of \"Loading...\" while the data is being fetched. Inside this `Suspense` component, there is an `h2` element that displays the heading \"Characters in episode:\". Below the heading, there is an `ul` element that contains a `For` component. The `For` component iterates over the `charactersInEpisode` query resource and renders a `li` element for each character. Each `li` element contains a `Link` component from the `atomic-router-solid` package. The `Link` component is used to create a link to the character's route, passing the character's ID as a parameter. The character's name is displayed as the text content of the `Link` component.\n\nOverall, the `EpisodePage` component is responsible for fetching and rendering the details of an episode and the characters in that episode. It uses query resources to handle data fetching and rendering components from various packages to display the episode and character information. This component can be used as a page in the larger `farfetched` project to display episode details and allow users to navigate to individual character pages.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `createQueryResource` function and how does it work?**\nThe developer might want to know how the `createQueryResource` function is used and what it does in the context of this code. \n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `characterRoute` variable and how is it used?**\nThe developer might want to understand the role of the `characterRoute` variable and how it is used in the `<Link>` component.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `charactersInEpisodeQuery` and `curentEpisodeQuery` variables?**\nThe developer might want to know what data these variables represent and how they are used in the `createQueryResource` function.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/pages/episode/view.md"}}],["64",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/pages/episodes_list/index.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a module export statement that exports the `EpisodesListPage` component from the `view` file. This code is part of the larger farfetched project and is used to organize and manage the components and views within the project.\n\nThe `EpisodesListPage` component is likely a React component that represents a page or view in the farfetched project. It may be responsible for displaying a list of episodes, such as episodes of a TV show or podcast. This component could be used to render a page that shows a user all available episodes, with options to filter or sort them.\n\nBy exporting the `EpisodesListPage` component, other files within the farfetched project can import and use this component. For example, another file may import the `EpisodesListPage` component and include it in a larger layout or routing system.\n\nHere is an example of how this code may be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\n// In a file called `App.js`\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { EpisodesListPage } from 'farfetched';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to Farfetched!</h1>\n      <EpisodesListPage />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `EpisodesListPage` component is imported from the `farfetched` module and included within the `App` component. This allows the `EpisodesListPage` component to be rendered as part of the overall application.\n\nOverall, this code is a simple module export statement that exports the `EpisodesListPage` component from the `view` file. This component is likely used to display a list of episodes in the farfetched project and can be imported and used in other files within the project.\n## Questions: \n **Question 1:** What is the purpose of the `EpisodesListPage` component? \n\n**Answer:** The `EpisodesListPage` component is exported from the `view` file, but it is not clear what functionality or UI it provides without further investigation.\n\n**Question 2:** Are there any other components or functions exported from the `view` file? \n\n**Answer:** It is unclear if there are any other exports from the `view` file, as only the `EpisodesListPage` component is explicitly exported in the given code.\n\n**Question 3:** What is the relationship between the `EpisodesListPage` component and the rest of the `farfetched` project? \n\n**Answer:** Without additional context, it is not clear how the `EpisodesListPage` component fits into the overall structure or purpose of the `farfetched` project.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/pages/episodes_list/index.md"}}],["65",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/pages/episodes_list/model.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a module that is part of the larger farfetched project. The purpose of this code is to handle the querying of episodes for a specific page in the project.\n\nThe code begins by importing the `attachOperation` function from the `@farfetched/core` module, as well as the `sample` function from the `effector` module. It also imports the `episodeListRoute` and `episodePageQuery` functions from the `../../entities/episode` module.\n\nThe `attachOperation` function is then used to create a new function called `episodesQuery`, which is a modified version of the `episodePageQuery` function. This modified function is used to query episodes for a specific page.\n\nNext, the code creates a new store called `$currentPage` using the `episodeListRoute.$params` store. The `$currentPage` store maps over the `params` object and extracts the `page` property. If the `page` property is not present, it defaults to 1.\n\nFinally, the `sample` function is used to create a new sample unit. This sample unit is triggered whenever either the `episodeListRoute.opened` or `episodeListRoute.updated` events occur. It takes the `$currentPage` store as the source and the `episodesQuery.start` function as the target. This means that whenever the `episodeListRoute` is opened or updated, the `episodesQuery.start` function will be called with the current page as the argument.\n\nThe code then exports the `$currentPage` store and the `episodesQuery` function, making them available for use in other parts of the project.\n\nIn the larger farfetched project, this code is likely used to handle the querying of episodes for a specific page. It provides a way to retrieve the current page from the `episodeListRoute` and pass it to the `episodesQuery` function to initiate the query. This allows the project to display the appropriate episodes based on the current page.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `attachOperation` function from `@farfetched/core`?**\nThe `attachOperation` function is used to attach an operation to a specific query or mutation. It is likely used in this code to attach the `episodePageQuery` operation to the `episodesQuery` variable.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `sample` function from `effector`?**\nThe `sample` function is used to create a sample of a source signal at the moment when a clock signal emits. In this code, it is used to sample the `page` value from the `$currentPage` signal when either `episodeListRoute.opened` or `episodeListRoute.updated` signals emit, and then pass it as the source to the `episodesQuery.start` signal.\n\n3. **What are the possible values of the `page` parameter in the `episodeListRoute.$params` signal?**\nThe `page` parameter in the `episodeListRoute.$params` signal can have any value, but if it is not provided or is `null`, the `??` operator is used to default it to `1`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/pages/episodes_list/model.md"}}],["66",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/pages/episodes_list/view.tsx)\n\nThe code provided is a module that exports a React component called `EpisodesListPage`. This component is responsible for rendering a list of episodes and providing pagination functionality.\n\nThe component imports several dependencies, including functions and components from various libraries. These dependencies are used to create a query resource, handle routing, manage state, and render components.\n\nThe `EpisodesListPage` component starts by defining a state variable `currentPage` using the `useUnit` hook from the `effector-solid` library. This state variable is initialized with the value of `$currentPage`, which is likely a shared state managed by the `model` module.\n\nNext, the component calls the `createQueryResource` function from the `@farfetched/solid` library to create a query resource. This query resource is likely responsible for fetching the list of episodes from an external data source.\n\nThe component then renders a heading element `<h1>` with the text \"Episodes\". It also wraps the rest of the content in a `<Suspense>` component, which displays a fallback message \"Loading...\" while the data is being fetched.\n\nInside the `<Suspense>` component, the component uses the `<Show>` component from the `solid-js` library to conditionally render the content based on the result of the `data` query resource. If the data is available, it renders an ordered list `<ol>`.\n\nWithin the `<ol>`, the component uses the `<For>` component from the `solid-js` library to iterate over the `results` array obtained from the `data` query resource. For each episode in the `results` array, it renders a list item `<li>` with a link to the episode's details page. The link is created using the `Link` component from the `atomic-router-solid` library and the `episodeRoute` route.\n\nAfter rendering the list of episodes, the component renders a `Pagination` component. This component receives the `currentPage` state variable, the `info` object from the `data` query resource, and the `episodeListRoute` route as props. The `Pagination` component is likely responsible for rendering pagination controls and handling navigation to different pages of the episode list.\n\nOverall, the `EpisodesListPage` component is a high-level component that fetches a list of episodes, renders them in a list, and provides pagination functionality. It can be used as a page component in a larger project to display and navigate through a collection of episodes.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This code is part of the larger farfetched project and is used to import and use the `LocationPage` component in other parts of the project.\n\nThe `LocationPage` component is likely a React component that represents a page or view related to locations. It could be used to display information about different locations, such as their names, addresses, and other relevant details. This component may also include functionality for interacting with the locations, such as adding, editing, or deleting them.\n\nBy exporting the `LocationPage` component, other files in the farfetched project can import and use it.

It also imports query functions and routes from the `character` and `location` entities, as well as utility functions from the `shared` module.\n\nThe module defines two main queries: `currentLocationQuery` and `residentsQuery`. \n\nThe `currentLocationQuery` is created by attaching the `locationQuery` operation using the `attachOperation` function. This query is responsible for retrieving information about the current location. \n\nThe `residentsQuery` is created by attaching the `characterListQuery` operation using the `attachOperation` function. This query is responsible for retrieving a list of residents for a given location. The `mapParams` option is provided to the `attachOperation` function, which maps the URLs of the residents to their corresponding IDs using the `urlToId` utility function.\n\nThe `sample` function is then used to create a sample event that triggers the `currentLocationQuery` when the `locationRoute.opened` event occurs. The `fn` option is provided to the `sample` function, which extracts the `locationId` parameter from the event and returns it as an object with the key `id`. The `target` option is used to specify that the `currentLocationQuery.start` event should be triggered with the extracted `id` as the parameter.\n\nFinally, the `connectQuery` function is used to connect the `currentLocationQuery` to the `residentsQuery`. The `source` option is set to the `currentLocationQuery`, and the `fn` option is provided to extract the `residents` property from the `location` result and return it as an object with the key `params`.

This module is responsible for converting a URL string into an ID value. \n\nThe code begins by importing two modules: `Number` and `Static` from the `runtypes` library. The `Number` module is used to define a runtime type for numbers, while the `Static` module is used to extract the static type from a runtime type. \n\nNext, the code imports the `TUrl` type from the `url` module. This suggests that the `urlToId` function in this module expects a URL string as input. \n\nThe code then defines a new runtime type called `Id` using the `Number.withBrand` method. This method allows us to create a new runtime type that is a number, but with a specific brand attached to it. This brand can be used to differentiate this specific type of number from other numbers. \n\nAfter defining the `Id` type, the code creates a new type alias called `TId` using the `Static` module. This `TId` type represents the static type of the `Id` runtime type. \n\nFinally, the code defines a function called `urlToId` that takes a `TUrl` parameter (a URL string) and returns a value of type `TId` (a branded number). This function uses the `split` method to split the URL string by the '/' character and retrieves the last element of the resulting array. It then uses the `parseInt` function to convert this last element into a number. The `?? ''` part of the code is a nullish coalescing operator that ensures an empty string is used if the last element is null or undefined. The resulting number is then cast to the `TId` type using the `as` keyword and returned. \n\nThis module can be used in the larger farfetched project whenever there is a need to convert a URL string into a branded number ID. For example:\n\n```typescript\nimport { urlToId } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst url = 'https://example.com/api/items/123';\nconst id = urlToId(url);\nconsole.log(id); // Output: 123\n```\n\nIn this example, the `urlToId` function is called with a URL string and the resulting ID value is printed to the console.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `runtypes` library and how is it used in this code?\n- The `runtypes` library is imported and used to define a `Number` type and a `Static` type. It is likely used for type checking and validation.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `TUrl` type and where is it defined?\n- The `TUrl` type is used as the parameter type for the `urlToId` function. It is likely defined in the `./url` file, which is imported at the top of the code.\n\n3. What does the `parseInt(url.split('/').at(-1) ?? '', 10) as TId` expression do?\n- This expression takes the last segment of the URL (after splitting it by '/'), converts it to an integer using `parseInt`, and then casts it to the `TId` type. The `?? ''` part handles the case where the URL does not have a valid segment to convert.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/shared/id.md"}}],["74",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/apps/showcase/solid-real-world-rick-morty/src/shared/info.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a module that defines a data structure called `Info` and a type alias `TInfo`. It also imports the `Number`, `Record`, and `Static` types from the `runtypes` library, as well as the `Url` type from a local file called `url`.\n\nThe `Info` data structure is defined using the `Record` function from the `runtypes` library. It has four properties: `count`, `pages`, `next`, and `prev`. The `count` and `pages` properties are of type `Number`, while the `next` and `prev` properties are of type `Url` or nullable (`Url.nullable()`). This means that the `next` and `prev` properties can either be a valid URL or `null`.\n\nThe `TInfo` type alias is defined using the `Static` function from the `runtypes` library. It represents the static type of the `Info` data structure. This means that any variable or parameter declared with the `TInfo` type will be expected to conform to the structure defined by `Info`.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to define and enforce the structure of data objects that represent information about something. For example, if the project deals with retrieving and displaying information about books, the `Info` data structure can be used to define the structure of the response from an API that provides book information. The `TInfo` type alias can then be used to declare variables or parameters that are expected to hold or receive this book information.\n\nHere's an example of how this code can be used:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Info, TInfo } from 'farfetched';\n\n// Example response from an API\nconst response = {\n  count: 10,\n  pages: 2,\n  next: 'https://example.com/books?page=2',\n  prev: null,\n};\n\n// Validate the response against the Info structure\nconst validatedResponse: TInfo = Info.check(response);\n\n// Use the validated response\nconsole.log(validatedResponse.count); // Output: 10\nconsole.log(validatedResponse.pages); // Output: 2\nconsole.log(validatedResponse.next); // Output: 'https://example.com/books?page=2'\nconsole.log(validatedResponse.prev); // Output: null\n```\n\nIn this example, the `response` object represents the response from an API that provides book information. The `Info.check()` function is used to validate the response against the `Info` structure, ensuring that it has the correct properties and types. The validated response is then stored in the `validatedResponse` variable, which can be used to access the properties of the response with type safety.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `Static` type is used to create a type that represents the static (or runtime) version of a given type. The `String` type represents a string value.\n\nThe code then defines a new type called `Url` using the `String.withBrand` method. The `withBrand` method is a function provided by the 'runtypes' library that allows you to create a new type by adding a brand to an existing type. In this case, the brand is 'URL', indicating that the `Url` type represents a URL string.\n\nNext, the code defines a type alias `TUrl` using the `Static<typeof Url>` syntax. This type alias represents the static version of the `Url` type.\n\nFinally, the code exports both the `Url` type and the `TUrl` type alias for use in other parts of the project.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to ensure that any variables or parameters representing URLs are of the correct type. For example, if a function expects a URL as an argument, it can be defined using the `TUrl` type alias:\n\n```typescript\nfunction fetchUrl(url: TUrl) {\n  // Fetch the URL\n}\n```\n\nBy using the `TUrl` type alias, the function is guaranteed to receive a valid URL string and can perform any necessary validation or processing on it.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to define and enforce the type of URL strings in the larger project, improving type safety and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors related to incorrect URL usage.\n## Questions: \n 1.

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows embedding HTML-like elements in JavaScript code.\n  - `\"jsxImportSource\": \"solid-js\"`: This option specifies the import source for JSX. It indicates that the JSX elements should be imported from the `solid-js` library.\n  - `\"allowJs\": true`: This option allows the compiler to process JavaScript files in addition to TypeScript files. This is useful when migrating an existing JavaScript project to TypeScript.\n  - `\"esModuleInterop\": true`: This option enables interoperability between CommonJS and ES modules. It allows importing CommonJS modules using ES module syntax.\n  - `\"strict\": true`: This option enables strict type-checking and additional type inference rules. It helps catch potential errors and enforce better coding practices.\n\n- `\"files\"`: This option specifies a list of individual files to be included in the compilation process. In this case, the list is empty, indicating that all files in the project should be included.\n\n- `\"include\"`: This option specifies a list of file patterns to be included in the compilation process. It uses glob patterns to match files. In this case, it includes all JavaScript, JSX, TypeScript, and TSX files in the `src` directory and its subdirectories.\n\nOverall, this configuration file ensures that the TypeScript compiler is set up correctly for the farfetched project.

This type represents a protocol for a chain of events that can occur in the project.\n\nThe `ChainProtocol` type is a generic type that takes a type parameter `RouteParams`, which represents a set of route parameters. This allows the `ChainProtocol` to be customized based on the specific route parameters used in the project.\n\nThe `ChainProtocol` type has three properties:\n\n1. `beforeOpen`: This property represents an event that is triggered before opening something. It is of type `EventAsReturnType<RouteParamsAndQuery<RouteParams>>`, which means it is an event that returns a value of type `RouteParamsAndQuery<RouteParams>`. The `RouteParamsAndQuery` type represents the parameters and query string of a route.\n\n2. `openOn`: This property represents an event that is triggered when something is opened. It is of type `EventAsReturnType<any>`, which means it is an event that returns a value of any type.\n\n3. `cancelOn`: This property represents an event that is triggered when something is canceled. It is also of type `EventAsReturnType<any>`.\n\nThese properties define the different stages of the chain of events that can occur in the project. The `beforeOpen` event is triggered before opening something, the `openOn` event is triggered when something is opened, and the `cancelOn` event is triggered when something is canceled.\n\nThe `ChainProtocol` type can be used in the larger `farfetched` project to define and enforce a consistent protocol for chains of events. For example, it can be used to define the protocol for a series of actions that need to occur in a specific order, such as fetching data from an API, processing the data, and displaying it to the user.\n\nHere is an example of how the `ChainProtocol` type can be used:\n\n```typescript\ntype MyRouteParams = {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n};\n\nconst myChainProtocol: ChainProtocol<MyRouteParams> = {\n  beforeOpen: createEvent(),\n  openOn: createEvent(),\n  cancelOn: createEvent(),\n};\n\nmyChainProtocol.beforeOpen.watch((params) => {\n  console.log('Before opening:', params);\n});\n\nmyChainProtocol.openOn.watch(() => {\n  console.log('Opening something');\n});\n\nmyChainProtocol.cancelOn.watch(() => {\n  console.log('Canceling something');\n});\n\nmyChainProtocol.beforeOpen({ id: 1, name: 'example' });\n// Output: Before opening: { id: 1, name: 'example' }\n\nmyChainProtocol.openOn();\n// Output: Opening something\n\nmyChainProtocol.cancelOn();\n// Output: Canceling something\n```\n\nIn this example, we create an instance of `ChainProtocol` with `MyRouteParams` as the type parameter. We then define event handlers for each of the properties and trigger the events.

The purpose of this code is to create a controlled promise, which allows for more fine-grained control over the resolution and rejection of a promise.\n\nThe `Defer` type is a generic type that takes two type parameters: `Resolve` and `Reject`. It represents an object with three properties: `resolve`, `reject`, and `promise`. The `resolve` property is a function that takes a value of type `Resolve` and resolves the promise. The `reject` property is a function that takes an optional value of type `Reject` and rejects the promise. The `promise` property is a Promise object that represents the asynchronous operation.\n\nThe `createDefer` function creates and returns an instance of the `Defer` type. It initializes the `resolve` and `reject` properties with empty functions, and sets the `promise` property to `null`. It then creates a new Promise object and assigns it to the `promise` property. Inside the Promise constructor, it overrides the `resolve` and `reject` properties with the actual resolve and reject functions of the Promise. This allows the user of the `Defer` object to control when the promise is resolved or rejected.\n\nAdditionally, the `createDefer` function attaches an empty catch handler to the `promise` property. This is done to prevent unhandled promise rejections from causing errors or warnings in the console.\n\nThe `createDefer` function can be used in the larger project to create controlled promises. By using the `Defer` type and the `createDefer` function, developers can have more control over the resolution and rejection of promises, which can be useful in scenarios where precise control over asynchronous operations is required.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```typescript\nconst defer = createDefer<number, string>();\n\n// Resolve the promise with a value of 42\ndefer.resolve(42);\n\n// Reject the promise with an error message\ndefer.reject(\"Error occurred\");\n\n// Access the promise\ndefer.promise.then((value) => {\n  console.log(\"Resolved:\", value);\n}).catch((error) => {\n  console.log(\"Rejected:\", error);\n});\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Defer` type and how is it used in this code?\n- The `Defer` type is used to define an object that represents a controlled promise. It has properties `resolve`, `reject`, and `promise` that can be used to control the state and outcome of the promise.\n\n2. Why are the `resolve` and `reject` functions initially empty and then reassigned later?\n- The `resolve` and `reject` functions are initially empty because they will be reassigned with the actual resolve and reject functions when the promise is created. This allows the promise to be controlled externally.\n\n3. Why is the `promise` property set to `null` initially and then assigned a value later?\n- The `promise` property is set to `null` initially because it will be assigned the actual promise object when the promise is created. This ensures that the promise is accessible within the `createDefer` function and can be returned to the caller.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/atomic-router/src/defer.md"}}],["96",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/packages/atomic-router/src/fresh.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a module that exports a function called `freshChain`.

The `freshChain` function sets up three events: `beforeOpen`, `openOn`, and `cancelOn`. These events are used to trigger different actions at different stages of the data refresh process.\n\nThe `beforeOpen` event is created using the `createEvent` function from the `effector` library. This event is triggered before the data refresh process starts and takes a `RouteParamsAndQuery` object as its parameter.\n\nThe `openOn` event is also created using the `createEvent` function. This event is triggered when the data refresh process is successful or when the data is skipped due to freshness. It does not take any parameters.\n\nThe `cancelOn` event is created using the `createEvent` function as well. This event is triggered when the data refresh process fails or is skipped. It does not take any parameters.\n\nThe `sample` function from the `effector` library is used to define the behavior of these events. The `sample` function takes an object with three properties: `clock`, `fn`, and `target`.

It is a JSON file that contains a set of key-value pairs, where each key represents a compiler option and the corresponding value represents the desired setting for that option.\n\nIn this specific `tsconfig.json` file, there are several compiler options specified:\n\n- `\"extends\": \"../../tsconfig.base.json\"`: This option specifies that the current `tsconfig.json` file extends the configuration defined in the `tsconfig.base.json` file located two directories above the current directory. This allows for the reuse of common configuration settings across multiple projects.\n\n- `\"compilerOptions\"`: This section contains various compiler options that define how the TypeScript compiler should behave. Some notable options include:\n  - `\"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true`: This option enforces consistent casing in file names, which helps prevent issues related to case sensitivity in file systems.\n  - `\"strict\": true`: This option enables strict type checking and enforces stricter type rules, which helps catch potential errors at compile-time.\n  - `\"noImplicitOverride\": true`: This option prevents implicit overriding of methods and properties, ensuring that all overrides are explicitly declared.\n  - `\"noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature\": true`: This option disallows accessing properties using an index signature, which helps prevent potential runtime errors.\n  - `\"noImplicitReturns\": true`: This option enforces that all functions have a return statement or throw an error, reducing the chance of unintended behavior.\n  - `\"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch\": true`: This option requires explicit `break` statements in switch cases, preventing accidental fallthrough.\n\n- `\"files\"`: This option specifies an array of file paths that should be included in the compilation process. In this case, the array is empty, indicating that all TypeScript files in the project should be included.\n\n- `\"include\": [\"**/*.ts\"]`: This option specifies the file patterns to include in the compilation process.

The `typecheck` property is an object that has a single property `ignoreSourceErrors` set to `true`. This configuration option allows the project to ignore any type errors in the source code during testing. The `passWithNoTests` property is set to `true`, which means that the tests will pass even if there are no test cases defined. This can be useful during the initial stages of development when tests are not yet implemented.\n\nThe `plugins` property is an array that contains a single element, which is the result of calling the `tsconfigPaths` function. This function is used to enable TypeScript path mapping in the project. Path mapping allows developers to use custom paths instead of relative or absolute paths when importing modules. This can make the code more readable and maintainable.\n\nOverall, this configuration file sets up the testing and path mapping options for the farfetched project.

The purpose of this code is to provide a caching mechanism for storing and retrieving data in memory. \n\nThe code starts by importing necessary functions and types from external libraries and modules. These include `createEffect`, `createEvent`, `sample`, `scopeBind` from the 'effector' library, `time` from the '../../libs/patronus' module, `parseTime` from the '../../libs/date-nfs' module, and `createCacheAdapter` and `attachObservability` from the './instance' and './observability' modules respectively. It also defines two custom types, `Entry` and `Storage`.\n\nThe `inMemoryCache` function is the main function in this code. It takes an optional `config` object as a parameter, which can contain properties like `maxEntries`, `maxAge`, and `observability`. It initializes an empty `storage` object to store the cached data.\n\nThe function then creates several events using the `createEvent` function. These events include `saveValue`, `removeValue`, `itemExpired`, `itemEvicted`, and `purge`. These events are used to trigger specific actions in the cache.\n\nThe function also creates a `$now` store using the `time` function, which is used to keep track of the current time.\n\nNext, the function defines a `maxEntriesApplied` sample using the `sample` function. This sample is triggered by the `saveValue` event and applies the `maxEntries` limit to the storage. It calls the `applyMaxEntries` function to determine if the storage exceeds the `maxEntries` limit and evicts the oldest entry if necessary. The updated storage is then assigned to the `storage` variable.\n\nThe function also defines a sample that triggers the `itemEvicted` event when an entry is evicted from the storage.\n\nThe function defines a `removeValue` event handler that removes a specific key from the storage.\n\nIf the `maxAge` property is provided in the `config` object, the function sets up a timeout using the `setTimeout` function. This timeout triggers the `itemExpired` event after the specified `maxAge` time has passed. The `itemExpired` event then triggers the `removeValue` event to remove the expired entry from the storage.\n\nThe function creates an `adapter` object that contains several methods for interacting with the cache. These methods include `get`, `set`, `unset`, and `purge`. The `get` method retrieves an entry from the storage, checks if it has expired based on the `maxAge` property, and removes it if necessary. The `set` method adds a new entry to the storage. The `unset` method removes a specific entry from the storage. The `purge` method clears the entire storage.\n\nFinally, the function calls the `attachObservability` function to attach observability features to the cache adapter. This allows for monitoring and logging of cache-related events.\n\nThe `inMemoryCache` function returns the created cache adapter using the `createCacheAdapter` function.\n\nThe `applyMaxEntries` function is a helper function used by the `inMemoryCache` function. It takes the current storage, a new entry, and the `maxEntries` limit as parameters. It checks if the storage exceeds the `maxEntries` limit and evicts the oldest entry if necessary. It returns an object with the updated storage and the evicted key.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and configurable in-memory cache adapter that can be used in the larger `farfetched` project to improve data retrieval performance by caching frequently accessed data.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `inMemoryCache` function?**\nThe `inMemoryCache` function is responsible for creating an in-memory cache adapter with specified configuration options.\n\n2. **What events trigger the removal of a value from the cache?**\nThe `removeValue` event triggers the removal of a value from the cache when it is called.\n\n3. **How does the cache handle expired items?**\nIf the `maxAge` option is provided, the cache sets a timeout for each saved item. When the timeout expires, the `itemExpired` event is triggered, which in turn triggers the `removeValue` event to remove the expired item from the cache.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/core/src/cache/adapters/in_memory.md"}}],["106",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/packages/core/src/cache/adapters/instance.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a function called `createCacheAdapter` that is responsible for creating a cache adapter for the larger project called \"farfetched\". The cache adapter is used to store and retrieve data from a cache, which can improve the performance of the application by reducing the need to make expensive network requests.\n\nThe function takes in a parameter called `adapter`, which is an instance of a cache adapter. The cache adapter is an object that implements the `CacheAdapterInstance` interface. This interface defines the methods and properties that the cache adapter must have in order to be compatible with the larger project.\n\nInside the function, a new store is created using the `createStore` function from the 'effector' library. The store is initialized with the `adapter` parameter as its initial value. Additionally, two options are provided to the store: `serialize` and `sid`. The `serialize` option is set to 'ignore', which means that the store will not serialize the values stored in it. The `sid` option is set to 'ff.cache_instance', which is a unique identifier for the cache instance.\n\nThe function then returns an object that combines the `adapter` parameter with a special property called `__`. The `__` property contains a reference to the store created earlier, stored in a property called `$instance`. This allows other parts of the project to access and interact with the cache adapter through the store.\n\nHere is an example of how this code may be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { createCacheAdapter } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst myCacheAdapter = {\n  // implementation of cache adapter methods and properties\n};\n\nconst cache = createCacheAdapter(myCacheAdapter);\n\n// Access the cache instance through the store\nconsole.log(cache.__.$instance.getState());\n\n// Use the cache adapter methods\ncache.get('key');\ncache.set('key', 'value');\n```\n\nIn this example, a cache adapter is created using the `createCacheAdapter` function and a custom cache adapter object.

If the `options.hit` property is present, it sets up a `sample` effect that triggers when the `adapter.get.done` event occurs and the result is not null. It uses the `filter` function to check if the result is not null, and if true, it calls the `fn` function to extract the key from the `params` object and returns an object with the key.

Otherwise, the `name` property is added to the `prevNames` set, and the `name` property is returned as the unique ID.\n\nIf neither the `sid` nor the `name` properties exist in the `query` object's `__.meta` property, an error is thrown with a message indicating that either the `sid` or the unique name is required for caching.\n\nOverall, this module provides functions for generating unique keys for caching based on the properties of a `query` object.

The output hash value is typically represented as a hexadecimal string. The SHA-1 algorithm is widely used in various security applications, such as digital signatures and data integrity checks.\n\nThe `sha1` function is the main entry point of the code. It takes a string `source` as input and returns the SHA-1 hash of that string as a hexadecimal string. \n\nThe code follows the steps outlined in the SHA-1 algorithm specification to generate the hash. Here is a high-level overview of the steps:\n\n1. Preprocessing: The input string is converted to UTF-8 encoding and padded with a trailing '1' bit and additional '0' bits to ensure the length of the message is a multiple of 512 bits.\n\n2. Message Processing: The padded message is divided into 512-bit blocks and processed sequentially. Each block is further divided into 16 32-bit integers.\n\n3. Hash Computation: The algorithm initializes five working variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`) with the initial hash values. Then, it performs a series of operations on these variables and the message block to update the hash values.\n\n4. Final Hash: After processing all the message blocks, the final hash value is computed by concatenating the five hash values (`H0`, `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `H4`) and converting them to a hexadecimal string.\n\nThe code also includes several helper functions:\n- `f`: This function is used in the hash computation step to determine the specific operation to perform based on the current block index.\n- `ROTL`: This function performs a circular left shift operation on a 32-bit integer.\n- `toHexString`: This function converts a 32-bit integer to a hexadecimal string.\n- `encodeUTF8`: This function encodes a Unicode string into UTF-8 encoding.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to generate SHA-1 hashes for strings, which can be used for various security-related purposes in the larger project.\n## Questions: \n **Question 1:** What is the purpose of the `sha1` function?\n- The `sha1` function generates a SHA-1 hash of a given string.\n\n**Question 2:** What are the values of the constants `K` used in the code?\n- The constants `K` are an array of four hexadecimal values: `[0x5a827999, 0x6ed9eba1, 0x8f1bbcdc, 0xca62c1d6]`.\n\n**Question 3:** What is the purpose of the `encodeUTF8` function?\n- The `encodeUTF8` function encodes a multi-byte Unicode string into UTF-8 format.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/core/src/cache/lib/hash.md"}}],["116",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/packages/core/src/cache/lib/stable_stringify.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a function called `stableStringify` that takes in an unknown data type and returns a string representation of that data. The purpose of this code is to provide a stable and deterministic way to stringify data, meaning that the output will always be the same for the same input.\n\nThe function starts by creating a new Set called `seen` to keep track of objects that have already been processed. This is used to detect and prevent cyclic structures, which are objects that reference themselves in a way that would cause an infinite loop during serialization.\n\nThe main logic of the code is implemented in the `stringify` function, which takes in a `node` parameter representing the current object being processed. The function first checks if the `node` is `undefined` or `null` and returns the appropriate string representation. If the `node` is a number, it checks if it is finite and returns the number as a string or 'null' accordingly.\n\nNext, the function checks if the `node` is a function and throws a `TypeError` with the message \"Can't serialize function\". This is because functions cannot be serialized into a string representation.\n\nIf the `node` is not a function or a primitive type, the function checks if it is an object. If it is, it checks if the `node` has already been seen before by checking if it exists in the `seen` set. If it has been seen before, it throws a `TypeError` with the message \"Can't serialize cyclic structure\". This prevents infinite loops caused by cyclic references.\n\nIf the `node` is an array, the function recursively calls `stringify` on each element of the array and joins the results with commas to create a string representation of the array.\n\nIf the `node` is an object, the function first sorts the keys of the object and then recursively calls `stringify` on each value of the object. It then creates an array of key-value pairs in the format \"key:value\" and filters out any empty strings. Finally, it joins the key-value pairs with commas to create a string representation of the object.\n\nAfter the `stringify` function is defined, the `stableStringify` function calls `stringify` on the input `data` and returns the result.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to convert complex data structures into a stable and deterministic string representation. This can be useful for various purposes such as logging, caching, or transmitting data over a network.

This `Contract` type is not defined in the code snippet, but it can be assumed that it represents a contract that defines the structure and validation rules for the `Raw` and `Data` types.\n\nThe `createContractApplier` function creates an `Effect` object called `applyContractFx` using the `createEffect` function from the 'effector' library. This `Effect` object represents an asynchronous operation that can be triggered and observed. It takes in an object with three properties: `params`, `result`, and `meta`. The `params` property represents the input parameters for the contract, the `result` property represents the result data that needs to be validated, and the `meta` property represents additional execution metadata.\n\nThe `applyContractFx` effect has a handler function that is executed when the effect is triggered. Inside the handler function, the result data is checked against the contract using the `contract.isData` method.

This interface is likely used in the larger project to define a contract or set of rules for validating and processing data.\n\nThe `isData` method takes a parameter `prepared` of type `Raw` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the `prepared` data is of type `Data`. The `is` keyword is used to perform a type guard check, ensuring that the `prepared` data is of the specified `Data` type. This method is useful for checking if the data meets certain criteria or requirements before further processing.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `isData` method:\n\n```typescript\nconst contract: Contract<SomeRawType, SomeDataType> = {\n  isData: (prepared) => prepared instanceof SomeDataType,\n  getErrorMessages: (prepared) => [],\n};\n\nconst rawData: SomeRawType = ... // some raw data\nif (contract.isData(rawData)) {\n  // Process the data as SomeDataType\n} else {\n  // Handle the case where the data is not of type SomeDataType\n}\n```\n\nThe `getErrorMessages` method takes a parameter `prepared` of type `Raw` and returns an array of strings.

Each error type has its own unique `errorType` value and additional properties specific to that error type. For example, the `InvalidDataError` type has properties `validationErrors` of type `string[]` and `response` of type `unknown`. These error types provide more specific information about the error that occurred.\n\nHere are some examples of how these error types can be used in the larger project:\n\n```typescript\n// Handling an InvalidDataError\ntry {\n  // Some code that may throw an InvalidDataError\n} catch (error) {\n  if (error.errorType === INVALID_DATA) {\n    console.log('Validation errors:', error.validationErrors);\n    console.log('Response:', error.response);\n  }\n}\n\n// Handling a TimeoutError\ntry {\n  // Some code that may throw a TimeoutError\n} catch (error) {\n  if (error.errorType === TIMEOUT) {\n    console.log('Timeout:', error.timeout);\n  }\n}\n\n// Handling an HttpError\ntry {\n  // Some code that may throw an HttpError\n} catch (error) {\n  if (error.errorType === HTTP) {\n    console.log('Status:', error.status);\n    console.log('Status text:', error.statusText);\n    console.log('Response:', error.response);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a structured way of handling and representing different types of errors within the \"farfetched\" project. It allows for more specific error handling and provides a consistent error format throughout the project.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `FarfetchedError` type and its generic parameter?**\nThe `FarfetchedError` type is a generic type that represents an error in the `farfetched` project. The generic parameter `T` is used to specify the type of error.\n\n2. **What are the additional properties of the `InvalidDataError` interface?**\nThe `InvalidDataError` interface extends the `FarfetchedError` type and adds two additional properties: `validationErrors` of type `string[]` and `response` of type `unknown`.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `NETWORK` constant and the `NetworkError` interface?**\nThe `NETWORK` constant is a string representing a network error type. The `NetworkError` interface extends the `FarfetchedError` type and adds two additional properties: `reason` of type `string | null` and `cause` of type `unknown`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/core/src/errors/type.md"}}],["124",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/packages/core/src/fetch/any_signal.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a function called `anySignal` that is used to create an `AbortSignal` object. This function takes in an array of `AbortSignal` objects, as well as `null` or `undefined` values. It then creates a new `AbortController` object and assigns it to the `controller` variable.\n\nThe purpose of this function is to create a single `AbortSignal` object that can be used to listen for abort events from multiple `AbortSignal` objects. An `AbortSignal` is an interface that represents a signal that can be used to communicate with a DOM request (such as a fetch request) and abort it if needed.\n\nThe `anySignal` function sets up an event listener for each `AbortSignal` object in the input array. If any of the signals are already aborted, the `onAbort` function is called immediately to abort the `controller`. If not, the `onAbort` function is registered as an event listener for the `abort` event on each signal.\n\nThe `onAbort` function is responsible for aborting the `controller` and removing the event listener from each signal. It is called when any of the signals are aborted.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `signal` property of the `controller` object, which is the `AbortSignal` object that can be used to listen for abort events.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to handle abort signals from multiple sources. For example, if there are multiple asynchronous operations happening in parallel and any one of them is aborted, the `anySignal` function can be used to create a single `AbortSignal` object that represents the combined abort signal for all the operations. This allows for centralized handling of abort events and simplifies the code by avoiding the need to manage multiple `AbortSignal` objects separately.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nconst signal1 = new AbortController().signal;\nconst signal2 = new AbortController().signal;\n\nconst combinedSignal = anySignal(signal1, signal2);\n\ncombinedSignal.addEventListener('abort', () => {\n  console.log('Abort event received');\n});\n\n// Abort one of the signals\nsignal1.abort();\n```\n\nIn this example, the `anySignal` function is used to create a combined `AbortSignal` object from `signal1` and `signal2`. An event listener is then added to the `combinedSignal` to log a message when an abort event is received. When `signal1` is aborted, the event listener is triggered and the message is logged.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this code is to provide a flexible and reusable way to make API requests and handle the responses.\n\nThe `createApiRequest` function takes in a configuration object that specifies the request and response settings. The configuration object has several interfaces and types defined within the code, such as `StaticOnlyRequestConfig`, `ExclusiveRequestConfig`, `InclusiveRequestConfig`, etc. These interfaces define the structure and types of the request and response settings.\n\nThe `createApiRequest` function returns an effect function called `boundAbortableApiRequestFx`. This effect function is responsible for making the actual API request and handling the response. It takes in the request parameters and an abort context, and returns a result or an error.\n\nThe code also defines other helper functions and types, such as `attach`, `sample`, `abortable`, `formatUrl`, `formatHeaders`, etc. These functions and types are used internally by the `createApiRequest` function to handle various aspects of the API request and response, such as formatting the URL and headers, handling concurrency and abort settings, transforming the response, and handling errors.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and customizable way to make API requests and handle the responses. It can be used in a larger project to create API request handlers with different settings and behaviors, such as handling concurrent requests, setting timeouts, transforming responses, and handling errors.

The response configuration specifies that the response should be extracted as JSON. The `getUserRequest` function is then called with the user ID as a parameter, and the resulting user data is logged to the console.

The `createEffect` function takes three type parameters: `Request`, `Response`, and `TypeError`. These type parameters define the expected types of the request, response, and error objects respectively.\n\nThe `fetchFx` effect is then assigned a unique string identifier using the `sid` property.

This configuration object defines the details of the API request, such as the request method, headers, and body. The function then creates an API request using the `createApiRequest` function from the `api` module.\n\nOne important feature of the `createJsonApiRequest` function is that it adds a default `Content-Type` header of `application/json` to every request. This ensures that the request body is serialized as JSON.\n\nThe `createApiRequest` function is called with a modified configuration object.

These functions can be used in the larger project to handle various aspects of making API requests, such as merging API records, merging query strings, formatting headers, and formatting URLs.\n\nThe `mergeRecords` function takes in multiple API records as arguments and merges them into a single record. It iterates over each record and checks if it is an object. If it is, it iterates over the key-value pairs of the record and merges them into the `final` record. If a key already exists in the `final` record, the values are merged into an array. Otherwise, the value is assigned directly to the key.\n\nExample usage:\n```typescript\nconst record1 = { name: 'John', age: 25 };\nconst record2 = { name: 'Jane', email: 'jane@example.com' };\nconst mergedRecord = mergeRecords(record1, record2);\nconsole.log(mergedRecord);\n// Output: { name: ['John', 'Jane'], age: 25, email: 'jane@example.com' }\n```\n\nThe `mergeQueryStrings` function takes in multiple query strings as arguments and merges them into a single query string.

This function is a basic request effect that wraps around another function called `fetchFx`. The purpose of `requestFx` is to handle HTTP requests and provide some additional features.\n\nThe `requestFx` function is created using the `createEffect` function from the 'effector' library. It takes three generic parameters: `Request`, `Response`, and `NetworkError | HttpError`. These parameters define the types of the request, response, and error objects that can be used with this effect.\n\nInside the `requestFx` function, there is an asynchronous handler function that takes a `request` object as a parameter. This handler function first calls the `fetchFx` function with the `request` object to make the actual HTTP request. If an error occurs during the fetch operation, it catches the error and throws a `NetworkError` using the `networkError` function from the '../errors/create_error' module. The `NetworkError` object includes the error message and the original error as its cause.\n\nIf the response from the fetch operation is not successful (i.e., the `ok` property of the response is false), it throws an `HttpError` using the `httpError` function from the '../errors/create_error' module. The `HttpError` object includes the status code, status text, and the response body (if available) as properties.\n\nIf the response is successful, it simply returns the response object.\n\nThe `requestFx` function can be used in the larger project to handle HTTP requests and handle errors in a consistent manner. It provides a convenient way to make HTTP requests and automatically handles network errors and HTTP errors. Here's an example of how `requestFx` can be used:\n\n```typescript\nimport { requestFx } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst request = {\n  method: 'GET',\n  url: 'https://api.example.com/data',\n};\n\nrequestFx(request)\n  .then((response) => {\n    // Handle successful response\n    console.log(response);\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    // Handle error\n    console.error(error);\n  });\n```\n\nIn this example, `requestFx` is called with a request object that specifies the HTTP method and URL. The function returns a promise that resolves to the response object if the request is successful, or rejects with an error object if an error occurs. The response or error can then be handled accordingly in the `then` and `catch` blocks.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It is an inlined library that is used to handle timeouts and abort operations in JavaScript. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to abort an operation if it exceeds a specified timeout period.\n\nThe `TimeoutController` class has a private property called `timer`, which is the result of calling the `setTimeout` function. The `setTimeout` function is a built-in JavaScript function that executes a callback function after a specified delay. In this case, the callback function is `() => this.abort()`, which calls the `abort` method of the `AbortController` class.\n\nThe constructor of the `TimeoutController` class takes a `timeout` parameter, which represents the timeout period in milliseconds. It calls the constructor of the `AbortController` class using the `super()` keyword to initialize the `AbortController` functionality. It then assigns the result of the `setTimeout` function to the `timer` property.\n\nThere is also a patch included in the constructor to address an issue with Safari not supporting extending built-in classes. It sets the prototype of the `TimeoutController` instance to be the prototype of the `TimeoutController` class.\n\nThe `TimeoutController` class overrides the `abort` method of the `AbortController` class. It calls the `clear` method before calling the `abort` method of the parent class. The `clear` method uses the `clearTimeout` function to cancel the timeout set by the `setTimeout` function.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to handle timeouts and abort operations in JavaScript. It can be used in scenarios where there is a need to set a timeout for an operation and abort it if it exceeds the specified timeout period. Here is an example of how this code can be used:\n\n```javascript\nconst timeout = 5000; // 5 seconds\nconst controller = new TimeoutController(timeout);\n\n// Perform some asynchronous operation\nfetch('https://api.example.com/data', { signal: controller.signal })\n  .then(response => {\n    // Handle the response\n  })\n  .catch(error => {\n    if (error.name === 'AbortError') {\n      // Handle the timeout error\n    } else {\n      // Handle other errors\n    }\n  });\n```\n\nIn this example, a `TimeoutController` instance is created with a timeout of 5 seconds. The `signal` property of the `AbortController` class is passed as an option to the `fetch` function, which allows the operation to be aborted if it exceeds the specified timeout. The `catch` block handles the `AbortError` that is thrown when the operation is aborted due to the timeout.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\nA smart developer might want to know the overall purpose of this code and what problem it is trying to solve.\n\n2. **What is the significance of extending the `AbortController` class?**\nThe developer might be curious about why the `TimeoutController` class extends the `AbortController` class and what additional functionality it provides.\n\n3. **Why is there a patch for Safari?**\nThe developer might wonder why there is a specific patch for Safari and what issues it addresses.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/core/src/fetch/timeout_abort_controller.md"}}],["131",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/packages/core/src/libs/date-nfs/index.ts)\n\nThe code provided is exporting two entities, `parseTime` and `Time`, from a file located at `./time`.

It takes a string as input and returns a parsed time object. Here is an example usage of the `parseTime` function:\n\n```javascript\nimport { parseTime } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst timeString = '12:30 PM';\nconst parsedTime = parseTime(timeString);\n\nconsole.log(parsedTime); // Output: { hours: 12, minutes: 30, meridiem: 'PM' }\n```\n\nThe `Time` type is likely a custom data structure that represents a specific point in time. It may contain properties such as `hours`, `minutes`, and `meridiem` to store the hour, minute, and meridiem (AM/PM) values respectively. This type can be used to store and manipulate time-related data within the `farfetched` project.

This promotes code reusability and modularity within the project, as other modules can import and utilize these entities without having to duplicate the code.\n\nIn summary, this code exports the `parseTime` function and `Time` type from a file located at `./time`. These entities provide time-related functionality and can be used by other modules within the `farfetched` project to parse time strings and manipulate time data.\n## Questions: \n **Question 1:** What does the `parseTime` function do and how is it implemented?\n- The `parseTime` function is exported from the `time` module.

Here are a few examples of how the code can be used:\n\n```typescript\nconst time1: Time = '1 hour 30 minutes'; // '1 hour 30 minutes' is equivalent to 5400000 milliseconds\nconst milliseconds1 = parseTime(time1); // 5400000\n\nconst time2: Time = '2.5 seconds'; // '2.5 seconds' is equivalent to 2500 milliseconds\nconst milliseconds2 = parseTime(time2); // 2500\n\nconst time3: Time = 5000; // 5000 milliseconds\nconst milliseconds3 = parseTime(time3); // 5000\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Time` type and how is it used?\n- The `Time` type is used to represent different time durations, including hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. It can be used to store and manipulate time values in the code.\n\n2. How does the `parseTime` function work?\n- The `parseTime` function takes a `Time` value as input and returns the equivalent time duration in milliseconds. It splits the input value into parts, checks the type of each part, and calculates the corresponding duration in milliseconds based on the part's unit.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `hasEnding`, `extractNonNumeric`, and `parseNumber` helper functions?\n- The `hasEnding` function checks if a given string value has an allowed ending (unit) by comparing it with an array of allowed endings. The `extractNonNumeric` function removes numeric characters from a string value and returns the remaining non-numeric characters. The `parseNumber` function converts a string value to a number by either parsing it as a float or an integer. These helper functions are used in the `parseTime` function to determine the unit and value of each time part.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/core/src/libs/date-nfs/time.md"}}],["133",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/packages/core/src/libs/lohyphen/defer.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a TypeScript module that exports a function called `createDefer` and a type called `Defer`. \n\nThe `Defer` type is a generic type that takes two type parameters: `Resolve` and `Reject`. It represents a deferred promise that can be resolved or rejected. It has three properties:\n- `resolve`: a function that takes a value of type `Resolve` and resolves the promise.\n- `reject`: a function that takes an optional value of type `Reject` and rejects the promise.\n- `promise`: a property of type `Promise<Resolve>` that represents the promise itself.\n\nThe `createDefer` function is a factory function that creates and returns a `Defer` object. It takes two type parameters: `Resolve` and `Reject`, which default to `void`. It initializes a `defer` object with empty `resolve` and `reject` functions, and a `promise` property that is initially set to `null`.\n\nNext, it creates a new `Promise` object and assigns it to the `promise` property of the `defer` object. It sets the `resolve` and `reject` functions of the `defer` object to the respective resolve and reject functions of the `Promise` object.\n\nFinally, it adds a catch handler to the `promise` property to prevent any unhandled promise rejections. It returns the `defer` object.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to create deferred promises. A deferred promise is a promise that can be resolved or rejected at a later time. It provides a way to control the resolution or rejection of a promise externally. \n\nHere's an example of how this code can be used:\n\n```typescript\nconst defer = createDefer<number>();\n\n// Resolve the deferred promise after 1 second\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  defer.resolve(42);\n}, 1000);\n\n// Use the deferred promise\ndefer.promise.then((value) => {\n  console.log(value); // Output: 42\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, a deferred promise is created using the `createDefer` function. After 1 second, the deferred promise is resolved with the value `42`. The `then` method is used to handle the resolved value of the promise and log it to the console.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Defer` type and how is it used in this code?\n- The `Defer` type is used to define an object that has `resolve`, `reject`, and `promise` properties. It is used to create a controlled promise where the resolution and rejection can be manually triggered.\n\n2. Why are the `resolve` and `reject` functions initially empty and then reassigned later?\n- The `resolve` and `reject` functions are initially empty because they will be reassigned later when the promise is resolved or rejected. This allows the control over when the promise is resolved or rejected.\n\n3. Why is the `promise` property initially set to `null` and then assigned a value later?\n- The `promise` property is initially set to `null` because it will be assigned a new `Promise` instance later. This allows the `promise` property to be accessed and used before it is actually created.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/core/src/libs/lohyphen/defer.md"}}],["134",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/packages/core/src/libs/lohyphen/divide.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a function called `divide` that takes in two parameters: `items` and `predicate`. The purpose of this function is to divide an array of items into two separate arrays based on a given predicate function.\n\nThe `items` parameter is an array of elements of type `T` or `P`. The `predicate` parameter is a function that takes in an item of type `T` or `P` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the item should be included in the first array or the second array.\n\nThe function initializes two empty arrays, `left` and `right`, which will be used to store the items that satisfy the predicate and the items that do not satisfy the predicate, respectively.\n\nThe function then iterates over each item in the `items` array using a `for...of` loop. For each item, it checks if the item satisfies the predicate by calling the `predicate` function with the item as an argument. If the predicate returns `true`, the item is added to the `left` array using the `push` method. If the predicate returns `false`, the item is added to the `right` array after being casted as `any`.\n\nFinally, the function returns an array containing the `left` and `right` arrays, which represent the items that satisfy the predicate and the items that do not satisfy the predicate, respectively.\n\nThis function can be used in the larger project to filter and separate items based on a given condition. For example, if we have an array of numbers and we want to divide them into even and odd numbers, we can use this function as follows:\n\n```typescript\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];\n\nfunction isEven(num: number): boolean {\n  return num % 2 === 0;\n}\n\nconst [evenNumbers, oddNumbers] = divide(numbers, isEven);\n\nconsole.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\nconsole.log(oddNumbers); // [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `divide` function is used to separate the `numbers` array into two arrays: `evenNumbers` and `oddNumbers`. The `isEven` function is used as the predicate to determine whether a number is even or odd. The resulting arrays are then logged to the console.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What does the `item is T` syntax mean in the `predicate` parameter?**\nThe `item is T` syntax is a type predicate that checks if the `item` parameter is of type `T`. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the item is of type `T`.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `left` and `right` arrays?**\nThe `left` array is used to store items that satisfy the `predicate` condition, while the `right` array is used to store items that do not satisfy the `predicate` condition.\n\n3. **Why is `right.push(item as any)` used instead of directly pushing `item` to the `right` array?**\nThe `right.push(item as any)` is used to push the `item` to the `right` array without type checking. This is because the `right` array is defined as `Array<P extends T ? never : P>`, which means it only accepts items that are not of type `T`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/core/src/libs/lohyphen/divide.md"}}],["135",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/packages/core/src/libs/lohyphen/field.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a TypeScript function called `get` that is exported from a file in the `farfetched` project. The purpose of this code is to retrieve a value from an object based on a given path.\n\nThe `get` function takes in two generic type parameters: `T` and `P`. `T` represents the type of the object from which we want to retrieve a value, and `P` represents the type of the property we want to access within that object.\n\nThe function returns a new function that takes in an object of type `T` and returns the value of the property specified by the `path` parameter. The `path` parameter is of type `P`, which means it must be a valid key of the object `T`.\n\nHere's an example of how this code can be used:\n\n```typescript\ninterface User {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n  address: {\n    street: string;\n    city: string;\n  };\n}\n\nconst user: User = {\n  id: 1,\n  name: \"John Doe\",\n  address: {\n    street: \"123 Main St\",\n    city: \"New York\",\n  },\n};\n\nconst getName = get<User, \"name\">(\"name\");\nconst name = getName(user);\nconsole.log(name); // Output: \"John Doe\"\n\nconst getStreet = get<User, \"address\">(\"address\");\nconst street = getStreet(user);\nconsole.log(street); // Output: { street: \"123 Main St\", city: \"New York\" }\n```\n\nIn this example, we have an object `user` of type `User`. We use the `get` function to create two new functions: `getName` and `getStreet`. The `getName` function retrieves the value of the `name` property from the `user` object, while the `getStreet` function retrieves the value of the `address` property.\n\nBy returning a new function, the `get` function allows for easy reuse and composition.

These functions are used to check if a value is empty or not. \n\nThe `isEmpty` function takes a generic parameter `T` and a value `v` of type `T` or `undefined`. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the value is `undefined` or not. The `v is undefined` syntax is a type guard in TypeScript, which narrows down the type of `v` to `undefined` within the function's scope. If `v` is `undefined`, the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `isEmpty` function:\n\n```typescript\nconst value: string | undefined = undefined;\nconsole.log(isEmpty(value)); // Output: true\n\nconst anotherValue: number | undefined = 42;\nconsole.log(isEmpty(anotherValue)); // Output: false\n```\n\nThe `isNotEmpty` function is similar to `isEmpty`, but it returns the opposite result. It takes the same generic parameter `T` and value `v` of type `T` or `undefined`. It uses the `isEmpty` function internally to check if `v` is empty.

The function takes in two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether they are equal or not.\n\nThe function first checks if `a` and `b` are strictly equal using the `===` operator. If they are, it immediately returns `true`. This handles cases where `a` and `b` are the same object or primitive value.\n\nNext, the function checks if both `a` and `b` are NaN (Not a Number) using the `!==` operator. If they are both NaN, it returns `true`. This is because NaN is the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself.\n\nAfter that, the function determines the type of `a` and `b` using the `getType` helper function. The `getType` function checks if `a` is an array, a pure object (an object created using the object literal syntax), or a general object. It returns a string indicating the type.\n\nIf the types of `a` and `b` are not the same, the function returns `false`.\n\nIf the types are both pure objects, the function compares the keys of `a` and `b`. If the lengths of the key arrays are not equal, it returns `false`. Then, it iterates over the keys of `a` and checks if each key exists in `b`. If a key is missing in `b`, it returns `false`. It also checks if the values of the corresponding keys in `a` and `b` are equal by recursively calling `isEqual` on them. If any of the values are not equal, it returns `false`. If all keys and values are equal, it returns `true`.\n\nIf the types are arrays, the function checks if the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal. If they are not, it returns `false`. Then, it iterates over the elements of `a` and `b` and recursively calls `isEqual` on each pair of elements. If any pair of elements is not equal, it returns `false`. If all elements are equal, it returns `true`.\n\nIf the types are general objects, the function checks if the `valueOf` and `toString` methods of `a` and `b` are not the same as the default methods from `Object.prototype`. If they are not the same, it compares the return values of these methods. If the return values are equal, it returns `true`.\n\nIf none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe `isArrayLike` function is a helper function that checks if a value is an array or an array-like object. It first checks if the value is an array using the `Array.isArray` method. If it is, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it checks if the value has a `length` property that is a non-negative number and if it has elements at indices 0 and `length - 1`. If these conditions are met, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nOverall, this code provides a comprehensive and recursive approach to checking the equality of two values, handling various types and edge cases. It can be used in the larger project to compare objects, arrays, and other values for equality, which can be useful for tasks such as data validation, state management, and testing.\n## Questions: \n **Question 1:** What is the purpose of the `isEqual` function?\n\n**Answer:** The `isEqual` function is used to determine if two values are equal.

These generic types allow the function to be flexible and work with different types of objects.\n\nThe `mapValues` function first uses the `Object.entries` method to convert the input object `val` into an array of key-value pairs. It then uses the `map` method on this array to iterate over each key-value pair and apply the mapping function `fn` to the value. The result is an array of new key-value pairs, where the values have been transformed using the mapping function.\n\nFinally, the function uses the `Object.fromEntries` method to convert the array of key-value pairs back into an object.

This type is used to extract the keys from an object type `T` that are not optional, meaning they do not allow `undefined` as a value.\n\nThe `NonOptionalKeys` type is defined using mapped types and conditional types in TypeScript. Let's break down the code to understand how it works:\n\n```typescript\nexport type NonOptionalKeys<T> = {\n  [k in keyof T]-?: undefined extends T[k] ? never : k;\n}[keyof T];\n```\n\n- The `NonOptionalKeys` type is exported, which means it can be used outside of this file.\n- It takes a generic type `T` as a parameter, which represents the object type from which we want to extract the non-optional keys.\n- The type definition uses a mapped type to iterate over each key `k` in the `keyof T` (the keys of `T`) and applies a conditional type to determine if the key is non-optional.\n- The conditional type checks if `undefined` extends the type of the value associated with the key `T[k]`. If it does, it means the key is optional and should be excluded from the resulting type. If it doesn't, it means the key is non-optional and should be included in the resulting type.\n- The resulting type is an object with the non-optional keys as its keys, and the values are of type `never`. The `never` type is used here to create a type that cannot be instantiated, effectively excluding the optional keys from the resulting type.\n- Finally, the `[keyof T]` index access type is used to obtain the union of all the keys in the resulting object type.\n\nThis `NonOptionalKeys` type can be used in the larger project to enforce the presence of certain keys in an object type. By using this type, developers can ensure that certain properties are required and cannot be omitted or set to `undefined`. This can help prevent potential bugs and improve the reliability of the code.\n\nHere's an example of how the `NonOptionalKeys` type can be used:\n\n```typescript\ninterface Person {\n  name: string;\n  age?: number;\n  address: string;\n}\n\ntype RequiredKeys = NonOptionalKeys<Person>;\n// The type RequiredKeys is \"name\" | \"address\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the `RequiredKeys` type is assigned the result of applying the `NonOptionalKeys` type to the `Person` interface. The resulting type is a union of the non-optional keys from the `Person` interface, which are \"name\" and \"address\".\n## Questions: \n 1. **What does the `NonOptionalKeys` type do?**\nThe `NonOptionalKeys` type is a mapped type that takes an input type `T` and returns a union of all the keys in `T` that are not optional (i.e., keys that do not have the `undefined` type as a possible value).\n\n2. **What does the `-?` syntax mean in the `NonOptionalKeys` type?**\nThe `-?` syntax is used to make all the keys in `T` required. It removes the optional modifier (`?`) from each key in `T`.\n\n3. **What does the `never` type represent in the `NonOptionalKeys` type?**\nThe `never` type is used as a placeholder to exclude keys from the resulting union type.

The purpose of this function is to transform the structure of the input object by swapping the keys and values at different levels.\n\nThe function uses two generic type parameters, `ExternalKeys` and `InternalKeys`, which represent the types of the keys used in the input and output objects respectively. These type parameters ensure that the function can handle different types of keys.\n\nThe function starts by initializing an empty object called `result`, which will store the transformed object. \n\nNext, the function iterates over each key-value pair in the input object using a nested loop. The outer loop iterates over the keys of the input object, while the inner loop iterates over the keys and values of the nested objects within the input object.\n\nFor each key-value pair in the nested objects, the function updates the `result` object by assigning the value to a new key in the `result` object. The new key is created by swapping the positions of the outer and inner keys. This is done using the spread operator (`...`) to clone the existing value of the `result` object and then adding a new key-value pair with the swapped keys.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` object, which now contains the transformed structure.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate how this function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nconst input = {\n  externalKey1: {\n    internalKey1: 'value1',\n    internalKey2: 'value2',\n  },\n  externalKey2: {\n    internalKey1: 'value3',\n    internalKey2: 'value4',\n  },\n};\n\nconst output = zipObject(input);\n\nconsole.log(output);\n```\n\nOutput:\n```javascript\n{\n  internalKey1: {\n    externalKey1: 'value1',\n    externalKey2: 'value3',\n  },\n  internalKey2: {\n    externalKey1: 'value2',\n    externalKey2: 'value4',\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `zipObject` function transforms the input object by swapping the positions of the external and internal keys.

The `signal` property is an `effector` unit that can be used to trigger the aborting of the effect.\n\nThe `abortable` function returns an `effect` function that can be used to create an abortable effect. The `effect` function takes in two parameters: `p` (payload) and `ctx` (context). The `p` parameter represents the payload that will be passed to the effect, and the `ctx` parameter represents the context in which the effect will be executed.\n\nInside the `abortable` function, several variables and functions are defined. \n\nThe `runCallFx` function is an `effector` effect that is responsible for running the current call.

It does this by utilizing another function called `every` from the `./every` module.\n\nThe `and` function takes in an arbitrary number of boolean stores as arguments and returns a single boolean store.

This function is responsible for delaying the emission of an event by a specified amount of time. It is built using the `effector` library, which is a state management library for JavaScript applications.\n\nThe `delay` function takes in an object as its parameter, which includes the following properties:\n- `clock`: This is a unit that represents the event that triggers the delay.\n- `timeout`: This can be either a store that holds the timeout value in milliseconds or a direct number value representing the timeout.\n- `target`: This is an optional event that will be triggered after the delay.\n\nInside the function, a new effect called `timerFx` is created using the `createEffect` function from the `effector` library. This effect takes in an object with a `payload` and `milliseconds` property and returns a promise that resolves after the specified number of milliseconds. This effect is responsible for the actual delay.\n\nTwo `sample` calls are then made. The first `sample` call combines the `timeout` value with the `clock` event and passes them to a function that returns an object with the `payload` and `milliseconds` properties. This object is then passed as an argument to the `timerFx` effect. This means that whenever the `clock` event is triggered, the `timeout` value is sampled and used to delay the emission of the `timerFx` effect.\n\nThe second `sample` call listens to the `timerFx.doneData` event, which is emitted when the `timerFx` effect resolves. When this event is triggered, the `target` event is also triggered.\n\nFinally, the `target` event is returned as the result of the `delay` function.\n\nThis `delay` function can be used in the larger `farfetched` project to introduce delays between events or to schedule events to occur after a certain amount of time. For example, it can be used to delay the loading of data from an API or to schedule the execution of certain actions in a specific order.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The function is part of the larger `farfetched` project.\n\nThe `every` function has multiple overloaded signatures, allowing it to accept different types of arguments. It can take either an object with a `predicate` property and an array of `stores`, or it can take two separate arrays of `stores` and `predicate`. The `predicate` can be a function, a store, or a simple value.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `every` function:\n\n```javascript\nconst store1 = createStore(1);\nconst store2 = createStore(2);\nconst store3 = createStore(3);\n\nconst isGreaterThanZero = (value) => value > 0;\n\nconst result = every({\n  predicate: isGreaterThanZero,\n  stores: [store1, store2, store3],\n});\n\nresult.watch((value) => {\n  console.log(value); // Output: true\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the `every` function is used to check if every value in the `stores` array is greater than zero. The `isGreaterThanZero` function is used as the `predicate`. The result is a store that holds the boolean value `true`, indicating that every value in the `stores` array satisfies the `predicate`.\n\nInternally, the `every` function first determines the type of the `predicate` argument. If it is a function, it is assigned to the `checker` variable. If it is a store, it is mapped to a function that compares the store's value with a required value. If it is a simple value, a function is created that compares the value with the required value.\n\nThe `combine` function is then used to combine the values of all the stores into a single store called `$values`. The `checker` function is cast to a store and assigned to `$checker`. Finally, the `combine` function is used again to combine `$checker` and `$values`, and the `every` function is applied to the result using the `Array.prototype.every` method. The final result is a store that holds the boolean value indicating if every value in the `stores` array satisfies the `predicate`.\n\nOverall, the `every` function provides a flexible and reusable way to check if every value in a collection of stores satisfies a given predicate.

It returns a new store or event that is read-only.\n\nThe function is overloaded with two different signatures. The first signature is for a `Store` and the second signature is for an `Event`. This allows the function to be used with either type of object.\n\nThe implementation of the `readonly` function is quite simple. It takes the `storeOrEvent` argument and calls the `map` method on it. The `map` method is a method provided by the `effector` library that allows for transforming the values of a store or event. In this case, the `map` method is used to create a new store or event with the same values as the original, effectively creating a copy. Since the `map` method does not modify the original store or event, the resulting store or event is read-only.\n\nHere is an example of how the `readonly` function can be used:\n\n```typescript\nimport { createStore, createEvent } from 'effector';\n\nconst count = createStore(0);\nconst increment = createEvent();\n\nconst readonlyCount = readonly(count);\nconst readonlyIncrement = readonly(increment);\n\nreadonlyCount.watch((value) => {\n  console.log('Count:', value);\n});\n\nreadonlyIncrement.watch(() => {\n  console.log('Increment event fired');\n});\n\nincrement(); // This will log 'Increment event fired'\ncount.setState(10); // This will not modify the count store\n```\n\nIn this example, a `count` store and an `increment` event are created using the `effector` library. The `readonly` function is then used to create read-only versions of these objects. The `watch` method is used to subscribe to changes in the read-only objects and log messages when they occur. Finally, an attempt to modify the original `count` store is made, but it has no effect since it is read-only.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `readonly` function?**\nThe `readonly` function is used to create a read-only version of a store or event in the `effector` library.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `map` function in the `readonly` function?**\nThe `map` function is used to transform the value of the store or event to itself, essentially creating a copy of the original value.\n\n3. **What is the significance of the generic type `<T>` in the `readonly` function?**\nThe generic type `<T>` allows the `readonly` function to work with stores or events of any type, making it flexible and reusable.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/core/src/libs/patronus/readonly.md"}}],["151",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/packages/core/src/libs/patronus/serialization.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a TypeScript module that exports a function called `serializationForSideStore`.

The `serialize` function is of type `Serialize<D>`, which is a type alias defined in the code. The `Serialize` type is derived from the `createStore` function from the 'effector' library. It extracts the `serialize` property from the second parameter of the `createStore` function's parameters.\n\nThe purpose of the `serializationForSideStore` function is to determine the serialization behavior for the side store based on the value of the `serialize` parameter. If the `serialize` parameter is set to the string value `'ignore'`, the function returns the string value `'ignore'`. This indicates that the serialization should be ignored for the side store. Otherwise, if the `serialize` parameter is not provided or set to any other value, the function returns `undefined`, indicating that the default serialization behavior should be used.\n\nThis function can be used in the larger project to configure the serialization behavior for a side store. Developers can pass the `serialize` parameter to the `serializationForSideStore` function to specify a custom serialization function or set it to `'ignore'` to disable serialization for the side store.

This function is used to create a factory function that can be used to generate objects of a specific type. The purpose of this code is to provide a convenient way to create objects with a specific structure and behavior.\n\nThe `withFactory` function takes in an object as its argument, which contains several properties: `sid`, `name`, `loc`, `method`, and `fn`. The `sid` property is a required string that serves as an identifier for the object being created. The `name` property is an optional string that can be used to provide a name for the object. The `loc` property is an optional value that can be used to specify the location of the object. The `method` property is an optional string that can be used to specify a method for the object. Finally, the `fn` property is a required function that returns the object being created.\n\nThe `withFactory` function returns the result of calling the `withFastoryRow` function from the `effector` library, which is imported at the top of the file. The `withFastoryRow` function is not publicly documented in the `effector` library, so the code includes a `@ts-expect-error` comment to indicate that the TypeScript compiler should ignore any errors related to the missing type definition.\n\nBy using the `withFactory` function, developers can easily create factory functions that generate objects with a specific structure and behavior. This can be useful in scenarios where multiple objects of the same type need to be created with different configurations. Here's an example of how the `withFactory` function can be used:\n\n```typescript\nconst createPerson = withFactory({\n  sid: 'person',\n  name: 'John Doe',\n  loc: 'New York',\n  method: 'GET',\n  fn: () => {\n    return {\n      // object properties and methods\n    };\n  },\n});\n\nconst person = createPerson();\nconsole.log(person); // { sid: 'person', name: 'John Doe', loc: 'New York', method: 'GET', ... }\n```\n\nIn this example, the `createPerson` factory function is created using the `withFactory` function.

The code includes functions for normalizing sourced fields, creating sourced readers, reducing two arguments, normalizing static or reactive values, extracting sources, and combining sourced fields.\n\nThe `normalizeSourced` function takes a `field` parameter, which can be of type `Result`, `Store<Result>`, `Callback<Data, Result>`, or `CallbackWithSource<Data, Result, Source>`. It returns a store that represents a normalized version of the sourced field. The function checks the type of the `field` parameter and creates the appropriate store based on the type. If the `field` is a store, it combines the store with a function that returns the field value. If the `field` is a callback with a source, it combines the source store with a function that calls the callback with the parameters and the source. If the `field` is a callback without a source, it creates a store that calls the callback with the parameters. If the `field` is a plain value, it creates a store that returns the value.\n\nThe `createSourcedReader` function is similar to `normalizeSourced`, but it is specifically used for creating an effect that reads data from a sourced field. It takes a `field` parameter and returns an effect that reads the data from the field. The function checks the type of the `field` parameter and creates the appropriate effect based on the type. If the `field` is a store, it attaches the effect to the store. If the `field` is a callback with a source, it attaches the effect to the source store. If the `field` is a callback without a source, it creates an effect that calls the callback. If the `field` is a plain value, it creates an effect that returns the value.\n\nThe `reduceTwoArgs` function is used to reduce two arguments into a single result. It takes a `field` parameter, which can be of type `CallbackTwoArgs<FirstData, SecondData, Result>` or `CallbackTwoArgsWithSource<FirstData, SecondData, Result, Source>`, and a `clock` parameter, which is an event that triggers the reduction. The function checks the type of the `field` parameter and creates the appropriate field based on the type. If the `field` is a callback without a source, it creates a field that calls the callback with the two arguments. If the `field` is a callback with a source, it creates a field that calls the callback with the two arguments and the source.\n\nThe `normalizeStaticOrReactive` function is used to normalize static or reactive values. It takes a `v` parameter, which can be of type `T` or `Store<Exclude<T, undefined>>`, and returns a store that represents the normalized value. If the `v` parameter is a store, it returns the store. If the `v` parameter is undefined, it returns a store that contains null. If the `v` parameter is a plain value, it returns a store that contains the value.\n\nThe `extractSource` function is used to extract the source store from a sourced field. It takes a `sourced` parameter, which can be of type `Store<S>`, `CallbackWithSource<any, any, S>`, or any other type, and returns the source store or null if the sourced field does not have a source.\n\nThe `combineSourced` function is used to combine multiple sourced fields into a single sourced field. It takes a `config` parameter, which is an object that maps field names to sourced fields, and an optional `mapper` parameter, which is a function that maps the combined sourced fields to a single result. The function combines the sourced fields into a single source store and creates a function that calls the sourced fields with the data and source. If a mapper function is provided, it applies the mapper function to the combined sourced fields.\n\nThese utility functions and types provide a way to handle dynamically sourced data in the farfetched project. They allow for the normalization of sourced fields, the creation of sourced readers, the reduction of two arguments, the normalization of static or reactive values, the extraction of sources, and the combination of sourced fields. These functions and types can be used throughout the project to handle and manipulate dynamically sourced data.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `normalizeSourced` function?**\nThe `normalizeSourced` function takes a `field` parameter and returns a store that represents a normalized version of the `field`.

The `FetchingStatus` type is a union type that can have one of four possible string values: 'initial', 'pending', 'done', or 'fail'.\n\nThis code is likely part of a larger project that involves making HTTP requests or fetching data from an external source. The `FetchingStatus` type is used to keep track of the status of these fetch operations.\n\nBy using this type, the project can define variables or properties that hold the status of a fetch operation. For example, a variable `status` of type `FetchingStatus` can be declared and assigned an initial value of 'initial'. As the fetch operation progresses, the value of `status` can be updated to reflect the current state, such as 'pending' when the fetch is in progress, 'done' when the fetch is successfully completed, or 'fail' when the fetch encounters an error.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in a larger project:\n\n```typescript\nimport { FetchingStatus } from 'farfetched';\n\nfunction fetchData(): Promise<void> {\n  let status: FetchingStatus = 'initial';\n\n  // Update status to 'pending' before starting the fetch\n  status = 'pending';\n\n  return fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\n    .then(response => {\n      // Update status to 'done' when fetch is successful\n      status = 'done';\n      return response.json();\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n      // Update status to 'fail' when fetch encounters an error\n      status = 'fail';\n      console.error(error);\n    });\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `fetchData` function uses the `FetchingStatus` type to keep track of the status of the fetch operation. The `status` variable is initially set to 'initial', then updated to 'pending' before the fetch is started. After the fetch is completed successfully, the `status` is updated to 'done'.

It is commonly used in scenarios where an event may be triggered multiple times in a short period, but we only want to handle it once after a certain delay. \n\nThe `syncBatch` function takes an `Event` called `clock` as its parameter. This `clock` event represents the event that needs to be debounced. \n\nInside the function, several events and stores are created using the `createEvent` and `createStore` functions from the 'effector' library. These events and stores are used to manage the debouncing process. \n\nThe function creates a `tick` event using `createEvent<T>()`, which represents the debounced event that will be triggered after the debounce delay. \n\nA `timerFx` effect is also created using the `attach` function. This effect is responsible for handling the debouncing logic. It takes the `$timeoutId` store and `$rejecter` store as its source and clears the existing timeout and rejects the promise if they exist. Then, it creates a new promise that resolves after a delay of 0 milliseconds using `setTimeout`. The `saveReject` event is used to save the reject function, and the `saveTimeoutId` event is used to save the timeout ID. \n\nThe `$payload` store is used to store the payload of the `clock` event. It is initialized as an empty array and is updated whenever the `clock` event is triggered. \n\nThe `$canTick` store is used to determine whether the `tick` event can be triggered. It is initialized as `true` and is updated based on the `triggerTick` event and the `timerFx` event. \n\nThe `triggerTick` event is used to disable the `tick` event by setting `$canTick` to `false`. \n\nThe `sample` function is used to sample the `clock` event and update the `triggerTick` event when `$canTick` is `true`. \n\nThe `sample` function is also used to sample the `triggerTick` event and trigger the `timerFx` effect. \n\nFinally, the `sample` function is used to sample the `$payload` store and trigger the `tick` event when the `timerFx` effect is done. \n\nThe `tick` event is returned from the `syncBatch` function, allowing it to be used in the larger project to handle debounced events. \n\nHere's an example of how the `syncBatch` function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { syncBatch } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst myEvent = createEvent();\n\nconst debouncedEvent = syncBatch(myEvent);\n\ndebouncedEvent.watch((payload) => {\n  console.log('Debounced event triggered with payload:', payload);\n});\n\n// Trigger the event multiple times\nmyEvent('A');\nmyEvent('B');\nmyEvent('C');\n\n// Only the last event will be handled after the debounce delay\n// Output: Debounced event triggered with payload: C\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. **What does this code do?**\n   This code implements a function called `syncBatch` that takes an event as input and returns an event. It sets up a debounce mechanism where the returned event will only trigger after a certain delay if the input event is continuously triggered within that delay.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `$payload` store?**\n   The `$payload` store is used to store an array of payloads from the input event. It is updated whenever the input event is triggered, and the payload is added to the array. This store is used in the final sample block to extract the payload and pass it to the `tick` event.\n\n3. **Why is the `serialize` option set to `'ignore'` for certain stores?**\n   The `serialize` option is set to `'ignore'` for the `$timeoutId`, `$rejecter`, and `$payload` stores. This means that when the state of these stores is serialized (e.g., for server-side rendering), their values will be ignored and not included in the serialized state. This is likely done because these stores contain values that are not needed for server-side rendering and can be safely ignored.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/core/src/libs/patronus/sync_batch.md"}}],["156",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/packages/core/src/libs/patronus/time.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a part of the larger project called \"farfetched\".

The \"clock\" property can be either an Event or an Effect from the \"effector\" library.\n\nThe purpose of the \"time\" function is to create and return a Store that holds the current time. The Store is essentially a state container that can be subscribed to and updated. In this case, the Store will hold the current time as a number.\n\nInside the \"time\" function, a new Store called \"$time\" is created using the \"createStore\" function from the \"effector\" library. The initial value of the Store is set to the current time using the \"Date.now()\" function.\n\nThe \"sample\" function from the \"effector\" library is then used twice. The first \"sample\" call is used to sample the value of the \"clock\" Event or Effect. This means that whenever the \"clock\" Event or Effect is triggered, the \"sample\" function will be called. However, in this case, the \"fn\" parameter is empty, so no actual logic is executed when the \"clock\" is triggered.\n\nThe second \"sample\" call is used to sample the value of the \"readNowFx.doneData\" Event. This Event is triggered when the \"readNowFx\" Effect is done executing. The value of the \"readNowFx.doneData\" Event is then assigned to the \"$time\" Store, effectively updating its value to the current time.\n\nFinally, the \"$time\" Store is returned from the \"time\" function, allowing other parts of the project to subscribe to and use the current time.\n\nHere is an example of how this code can be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { time } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst currentTime = time({ clock: someEvent });\n\ncurrentTime.watch((value) => {\n  console.log('Current time:', value);\n});\n\n// Output: Current time: 1631234567890\n```\n\nIn this example, the \"time\" function is called with an Event called \"someEvent\" as the \"clock\" argument.

The contract defines the expected data structure for the mutation, the validation is an optional function to validate the data, and the data mapping is a function that maps the result of the mutation to a desired data structure.\n\nThe function then creates a remote operation using the `createRemoteOperation` function from another module. This remote operation is responsible for executing the mutation remotely. The configuration object is passed as an argument to the `createRemoteOperation` function, along with other necessary parameters such as the name, enabled status, and kind of operation.\n\nAfter creating the remote operation, the function defines two protocols: `unitShape` and `attachProtocol`. The `unitShape` protocol defines the shape of the mutation object and includes properties such as `pending` and `start`.

Here's an example of how this code can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { createMutation } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst myMutation = createMutation({\n  handler: (params) => {\n    // Perform some mutation logic here\n    return Promise.resolve('Mutation result');\n  },\n  name: 'MyMutation',\n  enabled: true,\n});\n\nmyMutation.execute({ param1: 'value1', param2: 'value2' })\n  .then((result) => {\n    console.log(result); // Output: 'Mutation result'\n  });\n```\n\nIn this example, a mutation object is created using the `createMutation` function. The `handler` property is provided, which defines the logic for performing the mutation. The `name` and `enabled` properties are also provided to configure the mutation object. The `execute` method of the mutation object is then called with some parameters, and the result of the mutation is logged to the console.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `createMutation` function?**\nThe `createMutation` function is used to create a mutation object that encapsulates the logic for executing a mutation operation. It can be configured with different options such as a handler function, an effect, and a contract.\n\n2. **What are the different overloads of the `createMutation` function and when should each be used?**\nThe `createMutation` function has three different overloads. The first overload should be used when only a handler function is provided. The second overload should be used when only an effect is provided. The third overload should be used when both an effect and a contract are provided.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `createHeadlessMutation` function and how is it used in the `createMutation` function?**\nThe `createHeadlessMutation` function is used to create a mutation object without any specific implementation details.

These are used in the larger project to handle remote operations and mutations.\n\nThe `Mutation` interface extends the `RemoteOperation` interface, which is likely defined in the `remote_operation` module. The `RemoteOperation` interface specifies the shape of a remote operation, including the parameters, data, and error types. The `Mutation` interface adds an additional property `@@unitShape`, which is a function that returns an object with two properties: `start` and `pending`. `start` is an `Event` that represents the start of the mutation, and `pending` is a `Store` that holds a boolean value indicating whether the mutation is currently pending.\n\nHere is an example of how the `Mutation` interface may be used in the larger project:\n\n```typescript\nimport { createEvent, createStore } from 'effector';\n\n// Define a mutation\nconst myMutation: Mutation<{ id: number }, { success: boolean }, Error> = {\n  '@@unitShape': () => ({\n    start: createEvent(),\n    pending: createStore(false),\n  }),\n  // ... other properties from RemoteOperation interface\n};\n\n// Check if a value is a mutation\nif (isMutation(myMutation)) {\n  // Perform mutation\n  myMutation['@@unitShape'].start();\n}\n```\n\nThe `isMutation` function is a type guard that checks if a given value is an instance of the `Mutation` interface. It does this by checking if the value has a property `__` with a `kind` property equal to `MutationSymbol`. This function can be used to determine if a value is a mutation before performing any mutation-related operations.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to define and handle mutations in the larger project. Mutations are remote operations that can be triggered and tracked using the `start` event and `pending` store respectively. The `isMutation` function allows for type checking and validation of mutation instances.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this function is to coordinate the execution of the target queries based on the state and results of the source query.\n\nThe `connectQuery` function takes an object `args` as its parameter, which contains the `source` and `target` properties. The `source` property represents the source query, while the `target` property can be either a single target query or an array of target queries.\n\nThe function begins by determining the `singleParentMode` based on whether the `source` is a single query or an object containing multiple queries. It then initializes the `children` and `parents` variables based on the `target` and `source` properties, respectively.\n\nNext, the function defines several helper units that are used in the coordination of the queries. These include:\n- `anyParentStarted`: A signal that indicates whether any of the parent queries have started.\n- `anyParentSuccessfullyFinished`: A signal that indicates whether any of the parent queries have successfully finished.\n- `$allParentsHaveData`: A store that represents whether all parent queries have data available.\n- `$allParentDataDictionary`: A store that contains the data from all parent queries. If `singleParentMode` is true, it contains the data from the single parent query. Otherwise, it combines the data from all parent queries into a dictionary.\n- `$allParentParamsDictionary`: A store that contains the parameters from all parent queries. If `singleParentMode` is true, it contains the parameters from the single parent query. Otherwise, it combines the parameters from all parent queries into a dictionary.\n\nFinally, the function establishes the relations between the parent and child queries using the `sample` function from the 'effector' library. It sets the `$stale` property of the child queries to true when any parent query starts. It also triggers the execution of the child queries when all parent queries have successfully finished and have data available. The `mapperFn` function is used to map the data and parameters from the parent queries to the parameters of the child queries.\n\nIn summary, the `connectQuery` function provides a way to connect a source query with one or more target queries in the larger project. It coordinates the execution of the target queries based on the state and results of the source query, ensuring that the target queries are executed at the appropriate times and with the correct parameters.

The query object is designed to work with the Effector library, which is a state management library for JavaScript applications.\n\nThe `createHeadlessQuery` function takes in a configuration object as its parameter. This configuration object specifies various properties and options for the query, such as the initial data, the contract for the remote operation, the data mapping function, and the validation function.\n\nThe function returns a query object that has several methods and properties. These include methods for refreshing the query, resetting the query state, and starting the query. There are also properties that represent the current state of the query, such as the data, error, and status.\n\nThe query object also has an internal implementation that handles the execution of the remote operation. It uses the `createRemoteOperation` function from another module to handle the actual fetching of data from the server. The query object listens to events from the remote operation and updates its internal state accordingly.\n\nThe query object also supports some additional features, such as handling stale data, attaching to a data source, and handling aborted queries.\n\nOverall, this code provides a high-level abstraction for creating and managing queries for fetching data from a remote server.

The configuration object can include properties such as `params`, `request`, `response`, and `concurrency`.\n\nThe `params` property is used to define the parameters of the API request. The `request` property is used to specify the details of the request, such as the URL, method, headers, and body. The `response` property is used to define how the response data should be processed and validated. The `concurrency` property is used to configure the concurrency strategy for the query.\n\nThe function internally creates a `requestFx` effect using the `createJsonApiRequest` function. This effect is responsible for making the actual API request using the specified request configuration.\n\nThe function also creates a `headlessQuery` object using the `createHeadlessQuery` function. This object represents the query and provides methods for executing the query and handling the response.\n\nThe `headlessQuery` object is configured with the specified parameters, request configuration, and response configuration. It also includes additional properties such as `enabled`, `name`, `serialize`, and `sourced` which are used for further customization of the query behavior.\n\nThe `headlessQuery` object's `executeFx` method is attached to the `requestFx` effect, so that when the query is executed, the API request is triggered.\n\nThe `createJsonQuery` function returns the `headlessQuery` object with the `executeFx` method replaced with the `requestFx` effect.

It also imports the `Serialize` type from the '../libs/patronus' module.\n\nNext, the code defines a constant `QuerySymbol` which is a Symbol used to identify the Query object. This symbol is later used in the `isQuery` function to check if a given value is an instance of the Query object.\n\nThe code then defines an interface `QueryMeta` which represents metadata associated with a Query object. It has three properties:\n- `serialize`: A function used to serialize the data in various cases, such as transferring state from server to client during server-side rendering or saving state to persistent storage during caching.\n- `initialData`: The initial data for the Query object.\n- `sid`: A string or null representing the session ID associated with the Query object.\n\nNext, the code defines an interface `QueryExtraLowLevelAPI` which represents additional low-level API methods for the Query object.

These functions are used to calculate the delay time for retrying an operation in a larger project called \"farfetched\".\n\nThe `linearDelay` function takes a `base` number and an optional `opts` object as parameters. The `base` number represents the base delay time for each retry attempt. The `opts` object is an optional parameter that allows customization of the delay behavior. If no `opts` object is provided, the function uses the `defaultOptions` object.\n\nThe `linearDelay` function returns another function that takes a `RetryMeta` object as a parameter. The `RetryMeta` object contains information about the current retry attempt. The returned function calculates the delay time by multiplying the `base` number with the `attempt` property of the `RetryMeta` object and adds a random addition generated by the `randomAddition` function.\n\nThe `exponentialDelay` function has a similar structure to the `linearDelay` function, but instead of multiplying the `base` number with the `attempt` property, it raises the `base` number to the power of the `attempt` property.\n\nThe `randomAddition` function takes a `DelayOptions` object as a parameter and extracts the `spread` property from the `randomize` property of the `DelayOptions` object.

It is part of a larger project called \"farfetched\". \n\nThe purpose of this code is to allow developers to retry failed remote operations with customizable retry configurations. It takes in a remote operation `operation` and a configuration object `params` that specifies the retry behavior. The function then sets up the necessary event handlers and stores to implement the retry logic.\n\nThe `retry` function first normalizes the `times` parameter to ensure it is a static or reactive value. It then creates a store `$attempt` to keep track of the current attempt number, starting with 1. The `$meta` store combines the `$attempt` store to provide metadata about the current attempt.\n\nThe function also creates an event `failed` that is triggered when a remote operation fails. This event contains information about the failed operation, such as the parameters, error, and execution metadata.\n\nThe function sets up a `newAttempt` event that is triggered whenever a new attempt should be made. This event is used to increment the `$attempt` store.\n\nThe function uses the `split` function from the `effector` library to split the `failed` event into two branches: `planNextAttempt` and `retriesAreOver`. The `planNextAttempt` branch is taken when the current attempt is less than or equal to the maximum number of attempts specified in the `times` parameter. This branch plans the next attempt by combining the failed operation parameters, error, and metadata. The `retriesAreOver` branch is taken when the maximum number of attempts has been reached.\n\nThe function then uses the `sample` function to delay the execution of the next attempt. It combines the `planNextAttempt` event with the `timeout` parameter to determine the delay duration. The `timeout` parameter can be a static or reactive value. The delayed execution triggers the `newAttempt` event and the `startWithMeta` event of the `operation` to initiate the next attempt.\n\nThe function updates the `$attempt` store by incrementing it whenever a new attempt is made. It also resets the `$attempt` store when the `operation` is successfully finished or started again.\n\nIf the `otherwise` parameter is provided in the `params` object, the function samples the `retriesAreOver` event and triggers the `otherwise` event.\n\nIf the `supressIntermediateErrors` parameter is set to `true`, the function modifies the behavior of the `operation` by wrapping its `dataSourceRetrieverFx` effect. It uses the `attach` function to attach the `$supressError` store to the effect's options. This allows the effect to suppress errors and retry the operation without propagating the error further. If an error occurs and is suppressed, the `failed` event is triggered with the relevant information.\n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable function for implementing retry logic for remote operations in the larger \"farfetched\" project.

The `RetryMeta` object can be used to keep track of the number of retry attempts made for a particular task. \n\nFor example, let's say there is a function called `performTask()` that performs a complex operation. If this operation fails, the code can create a `RetryMeta` object and increment the `attempt` property each time the task is retried. This information can then be used to implement a retry mechanism, such as limiting the number of retries or implementing an exponential backoff strategy.\n\nHere's an example of how this code could be used in the larger project:\n\n```typescript\nimport { RetryMeta } from 'farfetched';\n\nfunction performTask(): void {\n  let retryMeta: RetryMeta = { attempt: 0 };\n\n  while (retryMeta.attempt < 3) {\n    try {\n      // Perform the task\n      // ...\n      // If successful, break out of the loop\n      break;\n    } catch (error) {\n      // Log the error\n      console.error(error);\n\n      // Increment the retry attempt\n      retryMeta.attempt++;\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (retryMeta.attempt === 3) {\n    console.error('Task failed after 3 attempts');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `performTask()` function attempts to perform a task and retries it up to 3 times if it fails. The `retryMeta` object is used to keep track of the number of retry attempts. If the task fails after 3 attempts, an error message is logged.\n\nOverall, the `RetryMeta` interface provides a way to store and track retry attempt information in the larger project, allowing for the implementation of retry logic for certain operations or tasks.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `RetryMeta` interface?**\nThe `RetryMeta` interface is used to define the structure of an object that contains information about the number of attempts made for a retry operation.\n\n2. **What other properties can be included in the `RetryMeta` interface?**\nThe `RetryMeta` interface only includes the `attempt` property.

The `cache.ts` module sets up a caching mechanism for queries, with parameters for the adapter, staleness, and purge strategy. It uses the `queryUniqId` function from the `key.ts` module to assign a unique identifier to each query. The `key.ts` module provides functions for generating unique keys based on the properties of a query object. This efficient caching mechanism helps avoid unnecessary data duplication and improve performance.\n\n```typescript\nconst cacheResult = cache(query, { adapter: 'memory', staleAfter: 60, purge: 'event' });\nconst key = createKey({ sid: '123', params: ['param1', 'param2'], sources: ['source1', 'source2'] });\nconst uniqId = queryUniqId({ __: { meta: { sid: '123', name: 'query1' } } });\n```\n\nThe `libs` subfolder's content is not provided, hence a detailed explanation cannot be given.

This function is used to keep a query fresh by automatically refreshing it based on certain triggers or conditions.\n\nThe `keepFresh` function takes two parameters: `query` and `config`. The `query` parameter represents the query that needs to be kept fresh, and the `config` parameter specifies the configuration options for refreshing the query.\n\nThe `config` parameter can have the following properties:\n- `automatically`: A boolean value that indicates whether the query should be automatically refreshed. If set to `true`, the query will be refreshed automatically based on certain conditions. If not provided or set to `false`, the query will not be automatically refreshed.\n- `triggers`: An array of events or trigger protocols that can trigger the refresh of the query. If provided, the query will be refreshed whenever any of these events or trigger protocols are triggered.\n\nThe `keepFresh` function first divides the `triggers` array into two separate arrays: `triggerEvents` and `protocolCompatibleObjects`. The `triggerEvents` array contains all the events from the `triggers` array, and the `protocolCompatibleObjects` array contains all the trigger protocols from the `triggers` array.\n\nNext, the function checks if there are any trigger protocols in the `protocolCompatibleObjects` array. If there are, it sets up the necessary logic to handle the refresh of the query based on these trigger protocols. This includes creating a store called `$alreadySetup` to keep track of whether the setup has already been done, and defining the `setup` and `teardown` functions using the `createApi` function.\n\nThe function then uses the `sample` function to define the refresh logic based on the trigger protocols. It listens to the `query.finished.success` event and the updates of the `query.$enabled` store, and triggers the setup or teardown functions based on the values of these events and stores.\n\nAfter handling the trigger protocols, the function checks if the `automatically` property is set to `true`. If it is, it sets up the necessary logic to automatically refresh the query based on certain conditions.\n\nThe function creates a store called `$previousSources` to keep track of the previous sources of the query. It then uses the `combine` function to combine the `query.__.lowLevelAPI.sourced` array with the `normalizeSourced` function to get the partial sources of the query. The `sample` function is used to update the `$previousSources` store whenever the `query.finished.finally` event is triggered.\n\nNext, the function creates a store called `$nextSources` to keep track of the next sources of the query. It uses the `sample` function to update the `$nextSources` store whenever the `query.__.lowLevelAPI.sourced` array is updated and the query is not idle.\n\nFinally, the function defines the refresh logic based on the triggers. It uses the `sample` function to trigger the refresh of the query whenever the triggers are triggered and the query is not idle. It also updates the `query.$stale` store to indicate that the query is stale.\n\nOverall, the `keepFresh` function provides a way to automatically refresh a query based on certain triggers or conditions, ensuring that the query always stays fresh and up-to-date. This functionality can be useful in scenarios where real-time data is required or when data needs to be refreshed periodically.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `keepFresh` function?**\nThe `keepFresh` function is used to keep a query fresh by automatically triggering updates based on specified triggers or automatically based on certain conditions.\n\n2. **What are the possible configurations for the `keepFresh` function?**\nThe `keepFresh` function can be configured with either an `automatically` flag, a `triggers` array, or both.

It can be used to perform any necessary initialization or configuration before the trigger is fired.\n\nThe `teardown` property is also an `Event` that takes no arguments and is used to tear down the trigger.

We then set up the trigger, fire it with some data, and tear it down. The setup, teardown, and fired events are triggered accordingly, and the corresponding console logs are printed.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `Event` import from 'effector'?**\nThe smart developer might want to know what functionality or features the `Event` class from the 'effector' library provides and how it is used in this code.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `TriggerProtocol` type?**\nThe smart developer might want to understand the role and usage of the `TriggerProtocol` type in the code and how it relates to the overall functionality of the project.\n\n3. **Why does the `fired` property of the `TriggerProtocol` type accept either `Event<unknown>` or `Event<void>`?**\nThe smart developer might be curious about the reason behind having two possible types for the `fired` property and how it affects the behavior or usage of the `TriggerProtocol` type.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/core/src/trigger_api/trigger_protocol.md"}}],["177",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/.autodoc/docs/json/packages/core/src/update)\n\nThe `update.ts` file in the `farfetched` project is a crucial component that manages and updates queries and mutations.

This constant is of type `Validator<any, any, any>`, which is a generic type that takes three type parameters.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a default implementation of a validator function that always returns `true`. This validator function can be used to validate any type of data and will always consider it as valid.\n\nThe `Validator` type is imported from a module located at `./type`. This module likely contains the definition of the `Validator` type, which is used to define the signature of a validator function. The `Validator` type is a function type that takes three type parameters: `T`, `E`, and `C`. These type parameters represent the type of the data to be validated (`T`), the type of the error that can be thrown if the data is invalid (`E`), and the type of the context in which the validation is performed (`C`), respectively.\n\nThe `validValidator` constant is assigned a function expression that takes no arguments and always returns `true`. This function satisfies the signature of the `Validator` type, as it does not require any input data and always returns a boolean value. Therefore, it can be used as a default validator that considers any data as valid.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project as a fallback validator when a more specific validator is not provided. For example, if a form input field does not have a custom validator specified, the `validValidator` can be used to ensure that the input is considered valid by default.\n\nHere's an example of how this code can be used:\n\n```typescript\nimport { validValidator, Validator } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst customValidator: Validator<string, string, any> = (data) => {\n  // Custom validation logic\n  return data.length > 0;\n};\n\nfunction validateData(data: string, validator: Validator<string, string, any> = validValidator) {\n  if (validator(data)) {\n    console.log('Data is valid');\n  } else {\n    console.log('Data is invalid');\n  }\n}\n\nvalidateData('example'); // Output: Data is valid\nvalidateData(''); // Output: Data is valid (using the default validator)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `validateData` function takes a `data` parameter and an optional `validator` parameter. If the `validator` parameter is not provided, the `validValidator` is used as the default validator. The function then uses the provided or default validator to validate the `data` and logs the result.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this function is to validate data against a Runtype contract and return an error if the data does not conform to the contract.\n\nThe function takes a single parameter `data`, which is a Runtype contract for valid data. Runtype is a library that provides runtime type checking for JavaScript and TypeScript. The `runtypeContract` function returns an object of type `Contract<unknown, D>`, where `D` represents the type of the valid data.\n\nThe returned object has two properties:\n- `isData`: This property is a function that takes an input `raw` and checks if it conforms to the `data` contract. It uses the `guard` method of the Runtype contract to perform the validation. If the validation is successful, it returns `true`, indicating that the input is valid data. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n- `getErrorMessages`: This property is a function that takes an input `raw` and returns an array of error messages if the input does not conform to the `data` contract. It uses the `validate` method of the Runtype contract to perform the validation. If the validation is successful, it returns an empty array. If the validation fails, it checks if there are any error details available. If there are error details, it calls the `traverseErrorDetails` function to convert the error details into an array of error messages. If there are no error details, it returns an array with a single error message.\n\nThe `traverseErrorDetails` function is a helper function used by `getErrorMessages` to convert error details into error messages. It takes three parameters: `details`, `prevKey`, and `curKey`. The `details` parameter represents the error details, which can be a string or an object. If the `details` parameter is a string, it appends the `nextKey` (resolved using the `resolveKey` function) to the error message and returns it as an array. If the `details` parameter is an array, it recursively calls `traverseErrorDetails` for each element of the array. If the `details` parameter is an object, it recursively calls `traverseErrorDetails` for each key-value pair of the object.\n\nThe `resolveKey` function is a helper function used by `traverseErrorDetails` to resolve the next key in the error message. It takes two parameters: `prev` and `cur`, representing the previous key and the current key, respectively. If both `prev` and `cur` are defined, it concatenates them with a dot separator and returns the result. Otherwise, it returns the value of `prev` if it is defined, or the value of `cur` if it is defined.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to transform Runtype contracts into internal Contracts and perform data validation against those contracts. It can be used in the larger project to ensure that the data being processed conforms to the expected contract, and to handle any validation errors that occur.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `runtypeContract` function?**\nThe `runtypeContract` function takes a Runtype contract for valid data and transforms it into an internal Contract.

This function is part of the larger farfetched project and is used to handle data fetching and error handling.\n\nThe function takes in a `query` parameter, which is an object representing a query with three generic types: `Params`, `Data`, and `QueryError`. The `Params` type represents the parameters required for the query, the `Data` type represents the data returned by the query, and the `QueryError` type represents any potential errors that can occur during the query.\n\nThe function returns an array with two elements. The first element is a `Resource` object that represents the data returned by the query. The second element is an object with a `start` method that can be used to start the query with the specified parameters.\n\nInside the function, several SolidJS functions and hooks are used to handle the query and create the resource. The `useUnit` hook is used to track the query and retrieve its data, error, and pending status. The `createSignal` function is used to create a signal that tracks changes to the query, and the `createComputed` function is used to create a computed value that updates based on changes to the query.\n\nThe function also uses a `createDefer` function from a separate file called `defer`. This function is used to create a deferred promise that can be resolved or rejected later.\n\nThe main logic of the function is inside the `createComputed` block. It checks the pending and data status of the query and updates the `dataDefer` object accordingly. If the query is pending or has data, a new `dataDefer` object is created and the `rerun` signal is triggered. If the query returns data, the `dataDefer` object is resolved with the current data. If the query returns an error, the `dataDefer` object is rejected with the error.\n\nFinally, the `track` signal is bound to a `createResource` function, which creates the resource using the `dataDefer.promise`. This allows the resource to be used with SolidJS's suspense mechanism.\n\nOverall, the `createQueryResource` function is a utility function that handles data fetching and error handling for a given query. It creates a resource that can be used in the larger farfetched project to manage and display data from queries.\n## Questions: \n 1.

Why is there a check for the type of `currentError` in the code?\n- The check for the type of `currentError` is necessary because SolidJS introduced a breaking change in version 1.5, which requires errors to be converted to `Error` instances for compatibility.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/solid/src/create_query_resource.md"}}],["200",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/packages/solid/src/defer.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a TypeScript module that exports a function called `createDefer` and a type called `Defer`. \n\nThe `Defer` type is a generic type that takes two type parameters: `Resolve` and `Reject`. It represents a deferred promise that can be resolved or rejected. It has three properties:\n- `resolve`: a function that takes a value of type `Resolve` and resolves the promise.\n- `reject`: a function that takes an optional value of type `Reject` and rejects the promise.\n- `promise`: a property of type `Promise<Resolve>` that represents the promise itself.\n\nThe `createDefer` function is a factory function that creates and returns a new `Defer` object. It takes two type parameters: `Resolve` and `Reject`, which default to `void`. It initializes the `defer` object with empty `resolve` and `reject` functions, and a `promise` property that is initially set to `null`.\n\nNext, it creates a new `Promise` object and assigns it to the `promise` property of the `defer` object. It sets the `resolve` and `reject` functions of the `defer` object to the respective resolve and reject functions of the `Promise` object. This ensures that when the `resolve` or `reject` functions of the `defer` object are called, they will resolve or reject the underlying promise.\n\nFinally, it adds a catch handler to the `promise` property to prevent any unhandled promise rejections. This is done by calling the `catch` method on the `promise` property and passing an empty function as the catch handler.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a convenient way to create and control promises. The `createDefer` function allows you to create a deferred promise and obtain the `resolve`, `reject`, and `promise` properties as a single object. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to manually resolve or reject a promise, or when you want to control the timing of when the promise is resolved or rejected.\n\nHere's an example of how this code can be used:\n\n```typescript\nconst defer = createDefer<number>();\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  defer.resolve(42);\n}, 1000);\n\ndefer.promise.then((value) => {\n  console.log(value); // Output: 42\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, a deferred promise is created using the `createDefer` function. After a delay of 1 second, the promise is resolved with the value `42`. The `then` method is then called on the `promise` property to handle the resolved value and log it to the console.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Defer` type and how is it used in this code?\n- The `Defer` type is used to define an object that contains functions for resolving and rejecting a promise, as well as a promise property. It is used to create a controlled promise.\n\n2. Why are the `resolve` and `reject` functions initially empty functions?\n- The `resolve` and `reject` functions are initially empty functions because they will be assigned new functions later when the promise is resolved or rejected.\n\n3. Why is the `promise` property set to `null` initially and then assigned a new promise later?\n- The `promise` property is set to `null` initially because it will be assigned a new promise object later using the `new Promise()` constructor. This allows the `resolve` and `reject` functions to be called externally to control the promise.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/solid/src/defer.md"}}],["201",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/packages/solid/tsconfig.json)\n\nThe code provided is a configuration file written in JSON format.

This Struct is used to define the shape and type of the data that should be received. The function then returns an object that implements the Contract interface.\n\nThe Contract interface has two main properties: `isData` and `getErrorMessages`. \n\nThe `isData` property is a type guard function that checks if a given value conforms to the expected data structure defined by the superstruct Struct. It uses the `is` function from the superstruct library to perform the validation. If the value matches the expected structure, the function returns `true`, indicating that the value is valid data. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nHere's an example of how the `isData` function can be used:\n\n```typescript\nconst struct = superstruct.object({\n  name: 'string',\n  age: 'number',\n});\n\nconst contract = superstructContract(struct);\n\nconst data = {\n  name: 'John Doe',\n  age: 25,\n};\n\nif (contract.isData(data)) {\n  console.log('Data is valid');\n} else {\n  console.log('Data is invalid');\n}\n```\n\nThe `getErrorMessages` property is a function that takes a raw data value and returns an array of error messages if the data does not conform to the expected structure.

This means that any code or resources located in these directories will be included in the project.\n\nThis configuration file is typically used by a build or package manager tool to determine which packages should be included in the project. For example, if the farfetched project is built using a tool like npm or pip, this configuration file would be used to specify the dependencies that should be installed.\n\nBy defining the packages in this configuration file, it allows for easy management and installation of dependencies. It ensures that all the required modules and resources are included in the project, making it easier to distribute and deploy.\n\nOverall, this code plays a crucial role in the larger farfetched project by defining the packages and dependencies that are required. It ensures that all the necessary code and resources are included, making it easier to build, package, and distribute the project.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `packages` field in this code?**\nThe `packages` field is used to specify the directories or patterns of directories where the project's packages are located. \n\n2. **What does the `**` symbol mean in the `packages` field?**\nThe `**` symbol is a wildcard that matches any number of directories or subdirectories.

In this case, the executor has four properties: \"implementation\", \"schema\", and \"description\".\n\nThe \"implementation\" property specifies the path to the implementation file for the executor. In this case, the implementation file is \"./impl.js\". This file contains the actual code that will be executed when the executor is run.\n\nThe \"schema\" property specifies the path to a JSON schema file. This schema file defines the structure and validation rules for the input data that the executor expects. It ensures that the input data provided to the executor is in the correct format.\n\nThe \"description\" property provides a brief description of what the executor does. In this case, it states that the executor runs the \"size-limit\" tool. The \"size-limit\" tool is a tool used to analyze and control the size of JavaScript and CSS files in a project. It helps identify large files that may impact the performance of a web application.\n\nThis configuration file is used in the larger farfetched project to define and configure the different executors that will be used to perform various tasks.

It is designed to check the size of JavaScript files in a specified directory and compare it to a given size limit. The purpose of this code is to enforce size limits on JavaScript files and provide feedback if the limit is exceeded.\n\nThe code begins by importing necessary dependencies such as `size-limit`, `@size-limit/file`, `util`, `glob`, `path`, `bytes-iec`, and `@nrwl/devkit`. These dependencies are used for file size calculations, file handling, and logging.\n\nThe module exports an async function named `sizeLimitExecutor` that takes two parameters: an object containing `outputPath` and `limit`, and a `context` object. The `outputPath` specifies the directory where the JavaScript files are located, and the `limit` specifies the maximum size allowed for the files.\n\nInside the function, the `glob` package is used to find all JavaScript files in the specified directory. The `path.join` method is used to construct the file path. The result is an array of file paths.\n\nThe `sizeLimit` function from the `size-limit` package is then called with the `filePlugin` and the array of file paths as arguments. This function calculates the size of each file using the `@size-limit/file` plugin and returns an array of objects containing the file size information. The first element of the array is extracted and its `size` property is assigned to the `size` variable.\n\nThe code then compares the `size` to the `limit` using the `bytes.parse` method from the `bytes-iec` package. If the `size` is greater than the parsed `limit`, the `success` variable is set to `false`.\n\nIf the `success` variable is `false`, the `logger.error` method from the `@nrwl/devkit` package is used to log an error message indicating that the size limit has been exceeded. The current size and the limit are also logged.\n\nFinally, the function returns an object with a `success` property indicating whether the size limit was exceeded or not.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to enforce size limits on JavaScript files. It can be integrated into a build process or a deployment pipeline to ensure that the size of JavaScript files does not exceed a certain threshold. For example, it can be used in a continuous integration system to prevent large JavaScript files from being merged into the main codebase.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the significance of the `sizeLimit` and `filePlugin` variables?\n- The `sizeLimit` variable is a reference to the `size-limit` library, which is used to calculate the size of files. The `filePlugin` variable is a reference to the `@size-limit/file` plugin, which is used by `size-limit` to analyze individual files.\n\n3. How is the success of the size limit check determined?\n- The success of the size limit check is determined by comparing the calculated size of the JavaScript files to the parsed `limit` value using the `bytes.parse` function. If the size is less than or equal to the limit, the check is considered successful.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/tools/executors/size-limit/impl.md"}}],["225",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/tools/executors/size-limit/schema.json)\n\nThe code provided is a JSON schema definition file. JSON schema is a vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents. It provides a way to describe the structure and constraints of JSON data. In this case, the schema defines an object with two properties: \"$schema\" and \"type\". The \"$schema\" property specifies the version of the JSON schema being used, and in this case, it is using the \"http://json-schema.org/schema\" version. The \"type\" property specifies the type of the object, which in this case is \"object\".\n\nThis JSON schema may be used in the larger project to validate JSON data that is being used or processed. By defining a schema, the project can ensure that the JSON data conforms to a specific structure and set of constraints. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as validating user input, validating data received from an API, or ensuring consistency in data formats across different parts of the project.\n\nFor example, let's say the project has a feature that allows users to submit data in JSON format. Before processing this data, the project can use this JSON schema to validate the input and ensure that it meets the expected structure and constraints. Here's an example of how this validation can be done using a JSON schema validation library like Ajv in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nconst Ajv = require('ajv');\nconst schema = {\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/schema\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"cli\": \"nx\"\n};\n\nconst ajv = new Ajv();\nconst validate = ajv.compile(schema);\n\nconst inputData = {\n  \"cli\": \"nx\"\n};\n\nconst isValid = validate(inputData);\nif (isValid) {\n  console.log(\"Input data is valid\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Input data is invalid\");\n  console.log(validate.errors);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Ajv` library is used to compile the JSON schema and create a validation function. The `validate` function is then used to validate the `inputData` object against the schema. If the data is valid, the code outputs \"Input data is valid\". Otherwise, it outputs \"Input data is invalid\" and logs the validation errors.\n\nOverall, this JSON schema definition file plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and consistency of JSON data used in the larger project. It allows for easy validation and enforcement of a specific data structure and constraints.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\n   This code appears to be a JSON schema file, but it is unclear what it is used for or how it is related to the \"farfetched\" project.\n\n2. **What does the \"cli\" property in the JSON schema represent?**\n   It is not clear what the \"cli\" property represents or how it is used within the context of the \"farfetched\" project.\n\n3. **What is the significance of the \"$schema\" property in the JSON schema?**\n   The \"$schema\" property is referencing a URL, but it is unclear what the purpose of this URL is and how it relates to the JSON schema or the \"farfetched\" project.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/tools/executors/size-limit/schema.md"}}],["226",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/.autodoc/docs/json/tools/executors)\n\nUnfortunately, there is no information provided about the files and subfolders in the `.autodoc/docs/json/tools/executors` directory.

It creates a set of all the releases mentioned in the changelogs and initializes an empty map to store the merged changelogs. It iterates over each release, filters the related changes from the parsed changelogs, and groups them by version using the `groupByVersions` function. It then sorts the grouped changes in descending order of version using the `compareSemVer` function. For each version, it creates a log entry and adds the changes for each package. Finally, it adds the log entry to the map with the release as the key.\n\nAfter merging the changelogs, the code iterates over each release and changelog entry in the merged changelogs. It renders the changelog using the `renderChangelog` function, replaces dots in the release version with hyphens to create a file name, resolves the file path, and writes the rendered changelog to the file.\n\nThe `renderChangelog` function takes a tree-like structure representing the changelog, converts it to HTML using the `markdown` module, translates the HTML to markdown using the `node-html-markdown` module, formats the markdown using the `prettier` module, and makes links on commit hashes using the `makeLinksOnCommits` function.\n\nThe `parseChangelog` function takes a markdown string representing a changelog, parses it using the `markdown` module, extracts the name of the package from the header, groups the content by version and changes using the `groupByLevel` function, and returns an object containing the name and changes.\n\nThe `groupByLevel` function groups the data based on the specified target level. It iterates over the data, checks the level of each item, and creates a new group when the level matches the target level.\n\nThe `getRelease` function takes a version string, parses it using the `semver-parser` module, and returns a string representing the release version (e.g., \"1.0\" for \"1.0.0\").\n\nThe `makeLinksOnCommits` function takes a content string, searches for commit hashes in the content, and replaces them with links to the corresponding commits on GitHub.\n\nOverall, this code is responsible for finding and parsing changelog files, merging the parsed changelogs, rendering the merged changelogs, and writing the rendered changelogs to files.

This function is likely used to retrieve a message or summary of the changes made in a particular changeset. Here is an example usage of this function:\n\n```javascript\nconst changeset = {\n  summary: \"Added new feature XYZ\",\n  // other properties...\n};\n\nconst addMessage = getAddMessage(changeset);\nconsole.log(addMessage); // Output: \"Added new feature XYZ\"\n```\n\nThe `getVersionMessage` function takes a `releasePlan` object as a parameter. It filters the `releases` array within the `releasePlan` object to exclude any releases with a type of \"none\". It then retrieves the `newVersion` property of the first release in the filtered array. This function is likely used to retrieve a message or summary of the version being released.
