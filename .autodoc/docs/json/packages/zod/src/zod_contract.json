  "summary": "The code provided is a function called `zodContract` that is used to transform Zod contracts for `data` into an internal Contract. This function is part of the larger farfetched project and is used to handle data validation.\n\nThe `zodContract` function takes a parameter `data` which is a Zod Contract for valid data. Zod is a library for data validation and schema definition in JavaScript. It provides a way to define the shape and constraints of data using a fluent API.\n\nInside the `zodContract` function, there is an inner function called `isData`. This function takes a parameter `prepared` and checks if it conforms to the `data` contract. It uses the `safeParse` method of the `data` contract to validate the `prepared` data. If the validation is successful, it returns `true`, indicating that the `prepared` data is of type `D`.\n\nThe `zodContract` function returns an object that contains two properties: `isData` and `getErrorMessages`. The `isData` property is a reference to the inner `isData` function, allowing it to be used outside of the `zodContract` function. The `getErrorMessages` property is a function that takes a parameter `raw` and returns an array of error messages.\n\nThe `getErrorMessages` function first validates the `raw` data using the `safeParse` method of the `data` contract. If the validation is successful, meaning the `raw` data conforms to the `data` contract, an empty array is returned. Otherwise, the function maps over the `errors` property of the validation result and constructs error messages. Each error message includes the error message itself and the path to the error within the data.\n\nThis `zodContract` function can be used in the larger farfetched project to validate data against a Zod contract. It provides a way to transform Zod contracts into an internal Contract format and handle data validation. The `isData` function can be used to check if a given data object conforms to the contract, and the `getErrorMessages` function can be used to retrieve error messages for invalid data.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `zodContract` function?\n- The `zodContract` function transforms Zod contracts for `data` to an internal Contract. It treats any response that does not conform to `data` as an error.\n\n2. What is the role of the `isData` function within the `zodContract` function?\n- The `isData` function is a type guard that checks if the prepared data matches the specified Zod contract. It returns `true` if the data is of type `D`, otherwise `false`.\n\n3. What does the `getErrorMessages` function do?\n- The `getErrorMessages` function takes a raw input and validates it against the Zod contract. If the validation is unsuccessful, it returns an array of error messages. The error messages include the specific path where the error occurred, if applicable."
