      "summary": "The code provided is a module that exports a single named export called `zodContract` from a file located at `./zod_contract`. This module is part of the larger farfetched project and is used to provide a contract definition using the Zod library.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to encapsulate the contract definition for a specific data structure or object. In JavaScript, contracts are used to define the expected shape and types of data that should be passed into or returned from functions or methods. By defining a contract, developers can ensure that the data being used in their code meets certain requirements, reducing the likelihood of bugs or unexpected behavior.\n\nThe `zodContract` export is likely an instance of a Zod schema, which is a way to define the structure and types of data using a fluent API provided by the Zod library. This schema can be used to validate data against the defined contract, ensuring that it conforms to the expected shape and types.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in the larger farfetched project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { zodContract } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst userDataSchema = zodContract.object({\n  name: zodContract.string(),\n  age: zodContract.number(),\n  email: zodContract.string().email(),\n});\n\nfunction processUserData(userData) {\n  const validationResult = userDataSchema.safeParse(userData);\n\n  if (validationResult.success) {\n    // Data is valid, continue processing\n    // ...\n  } else {\n    // Data is invalid, handle the error\n    console.error(validationResult.error);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `zodContract` is used to define a contract for user data, specifying that it should have a `name` property of type string, an `age` property of type number, and an `email` property that is a valid email address. The `userDataSchema` is then used to validate the `userData` object passed into the `processUserData` function. If the data is valid, the function can continue processing it. If the data is invalid, an error is logged.\n\nBy using the `zodContract` module, the farfetched project can ensure that data is properly validated and conforms to the expected structure and types, improving the reliability and correctness of the code.",
      "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `zod_contract` module?**\n   The `zod_contract` module is being exported from the `farfetched` project, but it is not clear what functionality or data it provides.\n\n2. **Are there any other modules being exported from the `farfetched` project?**\n   The code snippet only shows the export of the `zod_contract` module, so it is unclear if there are any other modules being exported from the `farfetched` project.\n\n3. **What is the relationship between the `zod_contract` module and the rest of the `farfetched` project?**\n   Without further context, it is unclear how the `zod_contract` module fits into the overall structure and functionality of the `farfetched` project."

      "summary": "The code provided is a function called `zodContract` that is used to transform Zod contracts for `data` into an internal Contract. This function is part of the larger farfetched project and is used to handle data validation.\n\nThe `zodContract` function takes a parameter `data` which is a Zod Contract for valid data. Zod is a library for data validation and schema definition in JavaScript. It provides a way to define the shape and constraints of data using a fluent API.\n\nInside the `zodContract` function, there is an inner function called `isData`. This function takes a parameter `prepared` and checks if it conforms to the `data` contract. It uses the `safeParse` method of the `data` contract to validate the `prepared` data. If the validation is successful, it returns `true`, indicating that the `prepared` data is of type `D`.\n\nThe `zodContract` function returns an object that contains two properties: `isData` and `getErrorMessages`. The `isData` property is a reference to the inner `isData` function, allowing it to be used outside of the `zodContract` function. The `getErrorMessages` property is a function that takes a parameter `raw` and returns an array of error messages.\n\nThe `getErrorMessages` function first validates the `raw` data using the `safeParse` method of the `data` contract. If the validation is successful, meaning the `raw` data conforms to the `data` contract, an empty array is returned. Otherwise, the function maps over the `errors` property of the validation result and constructs error messages. Each error message includes the error message itself and the path to the error within the data.\n\nThis `zodContract` function can be used in the larger farfetched project to validate data against a Zod contract. It provides a way to transform Zod contracts into an internal Contract format and handle data validation. The `isData` function can be used to check if a given data object conforms to the contract, and the `getErrorMessages` function can be used to retrieve error messages for invalid data.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `zodContract` function?\n- The `zodContract` function transforms Zod contracts for `data` to an internal Contract. It treats any response that does not conform to `data` as an error.\n\n2. What is the role of the `isData` function within the `zodContract` function?\n- The `isData` function is a type guard that checks if the prepared data matches the specified Zod contract. It returns `true` if the data is of type `D`, otherwise `false`.\n\n3. What does the `getErrorMessages` function do?\n- The `getErrorMessages` function takes a raw input and validates it against the Zod contract. If the validation is unsuccessful, it returns an array of error messages. The error messages include the specific path where the error occurred, if applicable."
