  "summary": "The code provided is a module that implements a cache adapter for browser storage. It allows for storing and retrieving data from the browser's storage, such as localStorage or sessionStorage, with additional features like expiration and eviction.\n\nThe main function `browserStorageCache` is exported as the public API of this module. It takes a configuration object as an argument, which includes options for the cache adapter, such as the type of storage to use (`storage`), observability options (`observability`), maximum age of cached items (`maxAge`), maximum number of entries (`maxEntries`), and serialization options (`serialize`).\n\nThe `storageCache` function is the actual cache adapter implementation. It creates a set of effects and events that handle the storage operations, such as getting, setting, and removing items from the storage. It also includes events for item expiration and eviction. The `adapter` object is returned as the cache adapter.\n\nThe `metaStorage` object is used to store metadata about the cached items. It includes a store `$meta` that holds the metadata, and events `addKey` and `removeKey` to add or remove keys from the metadata. The metadata is stored as a JSON string in the storage using the key `__farfetched_meta__`.\n\nThe `setItemFx`, `getItemFx`, and `removeItemFx` effects are used to interact with the browser's storage API. They are responsible for setting, getting, and removing items from the storage.\n\nThe `purge` event triggers the removal of all cached items. It uses the `purgeFx` effect to remove multiple items in parallel.\n\nThe `itemExpired` event is triggered when an item in the cache has expired based on its maximum age. It removes the expired item from the storage.\n\nThe `itemEvicted` event is triggered when an item is evicted from the cache due to reaching the maximum number of entries. It also removes the evicted item from the storage.\n\nThe `attachObservability` function is called to attach observability options to the cache adapter. It takes the adapter, observability options, and the `itemExpired` and `itemEvicted` events as arguments.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and configurable cache adapter for browser storage, allowing for efficient data caching and retrieval with additional features like expiration and eviction. It can be used in various scenarios where caching is required, such as optimizing network requests or storing frequently accessed data.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `browserStorageCache` function?**\nThe `browserStorageCache` function is responsible for creating a cache adapter that utilizes browser storage (e.g., localStorage) to store and retrieve cached data.\n\n2. **What are the effects and events used in the `storageCache` function?**\nThe `storageCache` function uses effects such as `getSavedItemFx`, `setSavedItemFx`, and `removeSavedItemFx` to interact with the browser storage. It also uses events like `itemExpired` and `itemEvicted` to handle expired or evicted cache items.\n\n3. **What is the role of the `$meta` store and the `metaStorage` object?**\nThe `$meta` store holds the metadata associated with the cache, such as the keys of the cached items. The `metaStorage` object provides functionality to add or remove keys from the metadata store."
