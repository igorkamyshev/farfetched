  "summary": "The code provided is a function called `createContractApplier` that creates and returns an `Effect` object. This function is part of the larger farfetched project and is used to apply a contract to a given set of parameters and result data.\n\nThe `createContractApplier` function takes in a `contract` parameter, which is an object of type `Contract<Raw, Data>`. This `Contract` type is not defined in the code snippet, but it can be assumed that it represents a contract that defines the structure and validation rules for the `Raw` and `Data` types.\n\nThe `createContractApplier` function creates an `Effect` object called `applyContractFx` using the `createEffect` function from the 'effector' library. This `Effect` object represents an asynchronous operation that can be triggered and observed. It takes in an object with three properties: `params`, `result`, and `meta`. The `params` property represents the input parameters for the contract, the `result` property represents the result data that needs to be validated, and the `meta` property represents additional execution metadata.\n\nThe `applyContractFx` effect has a handler function that is executed when the effect is triggered. Inside the handler function, the result data is checked against the contract using the `contract.isData` method. If the result data does not match the contract, an `invalidDataError` is thrown, which is a custom error object created using the `create_error` function from the '../errors' module. The `invalidDataError` object contains the validation errors from the contract and the original response data.\n\nIf the result data passes the contract validation, it is returned as the result of the effect.\n\nFinally, the `applyContractFx` effect is assigned a unique string identifier using the `sid` property.\n\nThe `createContractApplier` function returns the `applyContractFx` effect, which can be used in other parts of the farfetched project to apply the contract to different sets of parameters and result data.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { createContractApplier } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst contract = {\n  isData: (data) => typeof data === 'object',\n  getErrorMessages: (data) => {\n    if (typeof data !== 'object') {\n      return ['Invalid data type'];\n    }\n    return [];\n  },\n};\n\nconst applyContract = createContractApplier(contract);\n\napplyContract.watch((data) => {\n  console.log('Contract applied successfully:', data);\n});\n\napplyContract({\n  params: { id: 1 },\n  result: { name: 'John Doe' },\n  meta: { timestamp: Date.now() },\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, a contract object is defined with `isData` and `getErrorMessages` methods. The `createContractApplier` function is used to create an `applyContract` effect based on this contract. The `applyContract` effect is then triggered with a set of parameters, result data, and execution metadata. If the result data passes the contract validation, the `watch` callback will be called with the validated data. Otherwise, an error will be thrown.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `createContractApplier` function?\n- The `createContractApplier` function is used to create an `Effect` that applies a contract to a set of parameters, result, and meta data.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `applyContractFx` effect?\n- The `applyContractFx` effect is responsible for handling the application of the contract to the provided data, validating it, and returning the data if it passes the validation.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `sid` property in the `applyContractFx` effect?\n- The `sid` property in the `applyContractFx` effect is used to assign a unique identifier to the effect, which can be useful for debugging and tracking the effect's execution."
