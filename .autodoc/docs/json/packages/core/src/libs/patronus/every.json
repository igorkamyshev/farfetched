  "summary": "The code provided is a function called `every` that is used to determine if every value in a collection of stores satisfies a given predicate. The function is part of the larger `farfetched` project.\n\nThe `every` function has multiple overloaded signatures, allowing it to accept different types of arguments. It can take either an object with a `predicate` property and an array of `stores`, or it can take two separate arrays of `stores` and `predicate`. The `predicate` can be a function, a store, or a simple value.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `every` function:\n\n```javascript\nconst store1 = createStore(1);\nconst store2 = createStore(2);\nconst store3 = createStore(3);\n\nconst isGreaterThanZero = (value) => value > 0;\n\nconst result = every({\n  predicate: isGreaterThanZero,\n  stores: [store1, store2, store3],\n});\n\nresult.watch((value) => {\n  console.log(value); // Output: true\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the `every` function is used to check if every value in the `stores` array is greater than zero. The `isGreaterThanZero` function is used as the `predicate`. The result is a store that holds the boolean value `true`, indicating that every value in the `stores` array satisfies the `predicate`.\n\nInternally, the `every` function first determines the type of the `predicate` argument. If it is a function, it is assigned to the `checker` variable. If it is a store, it is mapped to a function that compares the store's value with a required value. If it is a simple value, a function is created that compares the value with the required value.\n\nThe `combine` function is then used to combine the values of all the stores into a single store called `$values`. The `checker` function is cast to a store and assigned to `$checker`. Finally, the `combine` function is used again to combine `$checker` and `$values`, and the `every` function is applied to the result using the `Array.prototype.every` method. The final result is a store that holds the boolean value indicating if every value in the `stores` array satisfies the `predicate`.\n\nOverall, the `every` function provides a flexible and reusable way to check if every value in a collection of stores satisfies a given predicate. It can be used in various scenarios within the larger `farfetched` project to perform data validation, filtering, or conditional rendering based on the state of multiple stores.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `every` function?\n- The `every` function is used to check if every value in a collection of stores satisfies a given predicate.\n\n2. What are the different ways the `every` function can be called?\n- The `every` function can be called with different combinations of arguments, including a configuration object with a predicate and an array of stores, an array of stores followed by a predicate, or just an array of stores.\n\n3. What does the `checker` variable represent in the `every` function?\n- The `checker` variable represents the function or predicate that is used to check if each value in the collection of stores satisfies the given condition."
