  "summary": "The code provided is a TypeScript function called `readonly` that can be used to create a read-only version of a store or event in the `effector` library. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to prevent modifications to a store or event, ensuring that their values cannot be changed.\n\nThe `readonly` function is a generic function that takes a single argument `storeOrEvent`, which can be either a `Store` or an `Event`. It returns a new store or event that is read-only.\n\nThe function is overloaded with two different signatures. The first signature is for a `Store` and the second signature is for an `Event`. This allows the function to be used with either type of object.\n\nThe implementation of the `readonly` function is quite simple. It takes the `storeOrEvent` argument and calls the `map` method on it. The `map` method is a method provided by the `effector` library that allows for transforming the values of a store or event. In this case, the `map` method is used to create a new store or event with the same values as the original, effectively creating a copy. Since the `map` method does not modify the original store or event, the resulting store or event is read-only.\n\nHere is an example of how the `readonly` function can be used:\n\n```typescript\nimport { createStore, createEvent } from 'effector';\n\nconst count = createStore(0);\nconst increment = createEvent();\n\nconst readonlyCount = readonly(count);\nconst readonlyIncrement = readonly(increment);\n\nreadonlyCount.watch((value) => {\n  console.log('Count:', value);\n});\n\nreadonlyIncrement.watch(() => {\n  console.log('Increment event fired');\n});\n\nincrement(); // This will log 'Increment event fired'\ncount.setState(10); // This will not modify the count store\n```\n\nIn this example, a `count` store and an `increment` event are created using the `effector` library. The `readonly` function is then used to create read-only versions of these objects. The `watch` method is used to subscribe to changes in the read-only objects and log messages when they occur. Finally, an attempt to modify the original `count` store is made, but it has no effect since it is read-only.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `readonly` function?**\nThe `readonly` function is used to create a read-only version of a store or event in the `effector` library.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `map` function in the `readonly` function?**\nThe `map` function is used to transform the value of the store or event to itself, essentially creating a copy of the original value.\n\n3. **What is the significance of the generic type `<T>` in the `readonly` function?**\nThe generic type `<T>` allows the `readonly` function to work with stores or events of any type, making it flexible and reusable."
