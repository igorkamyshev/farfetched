  "summary": "The code provided is a module that exports a function called `createJsonMutation`. This function is used to create a mutation object that can be used to make JSON API requests and handle the response.\n\nThe `createJsonMutation` function has multiple overloaded signatures, each with different combinations of parameters. The function takes a configuration object as an argument, which specifies the details of the mutation, such as the request URL, method, body, headers, and response handling.\n\nThe configuration object can include the following properties:\n\n- `request`: Specifies the details of the API request, such as the URL, method, body, and headers. The `url` property is a `SourcedField` that represents the URL of the request. The `method` property can be either `'GET'` or `'HEAD'` for GET and HEAD requests, or any other valid HTTP method for other types of requests. The `body` property is a `SourcedField` that represents the request body, and the `headers` property is a `SourcedField` that represents the request headers.\n\n- `response`: Specifies how the response from the API should be handled. It includes properties such as `contract`, `mapData`, `validate`, and `status`. The `contract` property is a contract object that defines the expected shape of the response data. The `mapData` property is a function that transforms the response data. The `validate` property is a function that validates the transformed data. The `status` property specifies the expected HTTP status code of the response.\n\nThe `createJsonMutation` function internally uses the `createJsonApiRequest` function to create an effect that represents the API request. It also uses the `createHeadlessMutation` function to create a headless mutation object that handles the response data.\n\nThe `createJsonMutation` function attaches the necessary parameters and sources to the headless mutation object and sets up the execution of the API request effect. It returns the headless mutation object with the API request effect attached.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and reusable way to create mutation objects for making JSON API requests and handling the responses in a structured manner. It can be used in a larger project to handle various API requests and responses.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `createJsonMutation` function?\n- The `createJsonMutation` function is used to create a mutation that makes a JSON API request and handles the response.\n\n2. What are the different types of configurations that can be passed to the `createJsonMutation` function?\n- The `createJsonMutation` function can be called with different configurations based on whether there are parameters and whether there is a need to map the data.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `headlessMutation` variable?\n- The `headlessMutation` variable is used to create a mutation without executing it. It sets up the contract, data mapping, validation, and other configuration options for the mutation."
