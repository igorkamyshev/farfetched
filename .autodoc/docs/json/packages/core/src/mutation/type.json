  "summary": "The code provided defines a `Mutation` interface and a `isMutation` function. These are used in the larger project to handle remote operations and mutations.\n\nThe `Mutation` interface extends the `RemoteOperation` interface, which is likely defined in the `remote_operation` module. The `RemoteOperation` interface specifies the shape of a remote operation, including the parameters, data, and error types. The `Mutation` interface adds an additional property `@@unitShape`, which is a function that returns an object with two properties: `start` and `pending`. `start` is an `Event` that represents the start of the mutation, and `pending` is a `Store` that holds a boolean value indicating whether the mutation is currently pending.\n\nHere is an example of how the `Mutation` interface may be used in the larger project:\n\n```typescript\nimport { createEvent, createStore } from 'effector';\n\n// Define a mutation\nconst myMutation: Mutation<{ id: number }, { success: boolean }, Error> = {\n  '@@unitShape': () => ({\n    start: createEvent(),\n    pending: createStore(false),\n  }),\n  // ... other properties from RemoteOperation interface\n};\n\n// Check if a value is a mutation\nif (isMutation(myMutation)) {\n  // Perform mutation\n  myMutation['@@unitShape'].start();\n}\n```\n\nThe `isMutation` function is a type guard that checks if a given value is an instance of the `Mutation` interface. It does this by checking if the value has a property `__` with a `kind` property equal to `MutationSymbol`. This function can be used to determine if a value is a mutation before performing any mutation-related operations.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to define and handle mutations in the larger project. Mutations are remote operations that can be triggered and tracked using the `start` event and `pending` store respectively. The `isMutation` function allows for type checking and validation of mutation instances.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `MutationSymbol` constant?\n- The `MutationSymbol` constant is used as a unique identifier for identifying mutations in the code.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `Mutation` interface?\n- The `Mutation` interface extends the `RemoteOperation` interface and adds additional properties and methods specific to mutations.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `isMutation` function?\n- The `isMutation` function is used to check if a given value is an instance of the `Mutation` interface."
