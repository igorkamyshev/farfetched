  "summary": "The code provided is a function called `resolveExecuteEffect` and a class called `InvalidConfigException`. The purpose of this code is to provide a utility function that resolves and returns an `Effect` object based on the provided configuration.\n\nThe `resolveExecuteEffect` function takes in a `config` parameter, which can be either an object with a `handler` property or an object with an `effect` property. The `handler` property is a function that takes in `Params` as input and returns a `Promise` of `Response`. The `effect` property is an instance of the `Effect` class, which also takes in `Params` as input and returns a `Promise` of `Response`. The function returns an `Effect` object that matches the provided configuration.\n\nHere's an example of how this function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { createEffect, Effect } from 'effector';\n\nconst fetchData = async (params) => {\n  // fetch data based on params\n  return response;\n};\n\nconst effect = createEffect(fetchData);\n\nconst resolvedEffect = resolveExecuteEffect({ effect });\n```\n\nIn this example, the `fetchData` function is a handler that takes in `params` and returns a `Promise` of the fetched data. The `createEffect` function is used to create an `Effect` object based on the `fetchData` handler. The `resolveExecuteEffect` function is then called with the `effect` property set to the created `Effect` object, and it returns the same `Effect` object.\n\nIf the `config` parameter does not have either a `handler` or an `effect` property, an `InvalidConfigException` is thrown with an error message indicating that either a `handler` or an `effect` must be passed to the config.\n\nThe `InvalidConfigException` class is a custom exception class that extends the built-in `Error` class. It takes in a `message` parameter and sets it as the error message for the exception.\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to resolve and return an `Effect` object based on the provided configuration, allowing for flexible usage of the `Effect` class in the larger project.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `resolveExecuteEffect` function?**\nThe `resolveExecuteEffect` function is used to create an `Effect` object that can either be based on a provided handler function or an existing `Effect` object.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `InvalidConfigException` class?**\nThe `InvalidConfigException` class is used to define a custom exception that is thrown when the `resolveExecuteEffect` function is called with an invalid configuration.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `is.effect` function?**\nThe `is.effect` function is used to check if a given object is an instance of the `Effect` class from the 'effector' library."
