  "summary": "The code provided defines a set of error functions that can be used in the larger project called \"farfetched\". These error functions are used to create specific error objects with predefined properties and explanations for different types of errors that can occur during HTTP requests.\n\nThe code imports the necessary types and constants from the 'type' module. The 'type' module likely contains definitions for different types of errors and their corresponding error codes.\n\nThe code then exports several functions that can be used to create specific error objects. Each function takes in a configuration object as an argument and returns an error object with predefined properties.\n\n- The `invalidDataError` function takes a configuration object with `validationErrors` and `response` properties and returns an `InvalidDataError` object. This error is used when the response from the server is considered invalid against a given contract.\n\n- The `timeoutError` function takes a configuration object with a `timeout` property and returns a `TimeoutError` object. This error is used when a request is cancelled due to a timeout.\n\n- The `abortError` function returns an `AbortError` object. This error is used when a request is cancelled due to a concurrency policy.\n\n- The `preparationError` function takes a configuration object with `response` and `reason` properties and returns a `PreparationError` object. This error is used when the extraction of data from the response fails.\n\n- The `httpError` function takes a configuration object with `status`, `statusText`, and `response` properties and returns an `HttpError` object. This error is used when a request is finished with an unsuccessful HTTP code.\n\n- The `networkError` function takes a configuration object with `reason` and `cause` properties and returns a `NetworkError` object. This error is used when a request fails due to network problems.\n\nThese error objects can be used in the larger project to handle different types of errors that can occur during HTTP requests. For example, if a request returns an invalid response, the `invalidDataError` function can be used to create an `InvalidDataError` object and handle it accordingly. Similarly, other error functions can be used to handle different types of errors in a standardized way throughout the project.",
  "questions": "1. **What are the different types of errors that can be thrown by this code?**\n   The different types of errors that can be thrown by this code are `InvalidDataError`, `TimeoutError`, `AbortError`, `PreparationError`, `HttpError`, and `NetworkError`.\n\n2. **What are the required parameters for each error function?**\n   The required parameters for each error function are as follows:\n   - `invalidDataError`: `validationErrors` (array of strings) and `response` (unknown)\n   - `timeoutError`: `timeout` (number)\n   - `abortError`: No required parameters\n   - `preparationError`: `response` (string) and `reason` (string or null)\n   - `httpError`: `status` (number), `statusText` (string), and `response` (string or JSON or null)\n   - `networkError`: `reason` (string or null) and `cause` (unknown, optional)\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `explanation` property in each error object?**\n   The `explanation` property in each error object provides a brief explanation or description of the error that occurred."
