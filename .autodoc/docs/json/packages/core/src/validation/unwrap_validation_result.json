  "summary": "The code provided is a function called `unwrapValidationResult` that takes in a parameter called `result` of type `ValidationResult` and returns an array of strings. \n\nThe purpose of this function is to handle the result of a validation process and convert it into a more usable format. The `ValidationResult` type is likely defined elsewhere in the project and represents the outcome of a validation check. \n\nThe function starts by checking if the `result` is equal to `true`. If it is, it means that the validation was successful and there are no errors. In this case, an empty array is returned.\n\nNext, the function checks if the `result` is equal to `false`. If it is, it means that the validation failed and there are errors. In this case, an array containing the string `'Invalid data'` is returned.\n\nIf the `result` is not a boolean value (neither `true` nor `false`), the function checks if it is an array. If it is not an array, it means that the `result` is a single error message. In this case, the function wraps the `result` in an array and returns it.\n\nFinally, if the `result` is an array, the function checks if it is empty. If it is, it means that the validation was successful and there are no errors. In this case, an empty array is returned.\n\nIf none of the above conditions are met, it means that the `result` is an array of error messages. In this case, the function simply returns the `result` array as is.\n\nThis function can be used in the larger project to handle the result of validation checks and convert them into a consistent format. It provides a standardized way of dealing with validation outcomes, making it easier to handle and display error messages to the user. \n\nHere is an example usage of the `unwrapValidationResult` function:\n\n```typescript\nimport { unwrapValidationResult } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst validationResult = validateData(data); // Perform some validation and get the result\n\nconst errors = unwrapValidationResult(validationResult); // Convert the validation result into an array of error messages\n\nif (errors.length > 0) {\n  displayErrors(errors); // Display the error messages to the user\n} else {\n  proceedWithData(data); // Proceed with the validated data\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. **What is the `ValidationResult` type?**\nA smart developer might want to know what the `ValidationResult` type is and what kind of data it can hold.\n\n2. **What does the function `unwrapValidationResult` do?**\nA smart developer might want to know the purpose and functionality of the `unwrapValidationResult` function.\n\n3. **What are the possible return values of the `unwrapValidationResult` function?**\nA smart developer might want to know the different return values that the `unwrapValidationResult` function can produce and under what conditions each value is returned."
