  "summary": "The code provided is a module export statement that exports the `typedContract` object from the `contract` file located in the `src` directory of the `farfetched` project. \n\nThe `typedContract` object is likely a module or class that provides a way to define and enforce contracts in a typed manner. Contracts are a way to specify the expected behavior and constraints of functions and methods. They can be used to ensure that the inputs and outputs of functions meet certain requirements, such as specific data types or ranges of values.\n\nBy exporting the `typedContract` object, this code allows other parts of the `farfetched` project to import and use the `typedContract` functionality. This can be useful for enforcing contracts and ensuring that the codebase adheres to certain rules and expectations.\n\nHere is an example of how the `typedContract` object might be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { typedContract } from 'farfetched';\n\n// Define a contract for a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum\nconst sumContract = typedContract({\n  inputs: {\n    a: 'number',\n    b: 'number',\n  },\n  output: 'number',\n});\n\n// Define a function that adheres to the contract\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\n// Apply the contract to the function\nconst sumWithContract = sumContract(sum);\n\n// Call the function, which will be checked against the contract\nconst result = sumWithContract(2, 3); // 5\n\n// If the function violates the contract, an error will be thrown\nconst invalidResult = sumWithContract('2', 3); // Error: Invalid input type for parameter 'a'\n```\n\nIn this example, the `typedContract` object is used to define a contract for the `sum` function. The contract specifies that the function should take two numbers as input and return a number as output. The `sumContract` function is then applied to the `sum` function, creating a new function `sumWithContract` that enforces the contract. When `sumWithContract` is called with valid inputs, it behaves like the original `sum` function. However, if the inputs do not match the contract, an error is thrown.\n\nBy using the `typedContract` object, the `farfetched` project can ensure that functions and methods throughout the codebase adhere to specific contracts, improving code reliability and maintainability.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `typedContract` export?**\nThe `typedContract` export is being imported from the `./src/contract` file. A smart developer might want to know what functionality or data this export provides.\n\n2. **Are there any other exports from the `./src/contract` file?**\nThe code only shows the export of `typedContract`, but a smart developer might wonder if there are any other exports from the `./src/contract` file that are not shown in this code snippet.\n\n3. **What is the overall purpose or functionality of the `farfetched` project?**\nThe code snippet only shows a single export, so a smart developer might be curious about the larger context of the `farfetched` project and what it aims to achieve."
