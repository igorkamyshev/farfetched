It contains source code located in the \"packages/core/src\" directory, as specified by the \"sourceRoot\" field.\n\nThe configuration file defines several targets, each with its own executor and options:\n\n1. \"pack\" target: This target runs a command using the \"nx:run-commands\" executor. The command executed is \"node tools/scripts/typepack.mjs --package core\". It depends on the \"build\" target.\n\n2. \"build\" target: This target uses the \"@nrwl/rollup:rollup\" executor to build the project. It specifies the output path, entry file, TypeScript configuration, project file, output format (ESM and CJS), and whether to generate an exports field. It uses the \"babel\" compiler.\n\n3. \"publish\" target: This target runs a command using the \"nx:run-commands\" executor. The command executed is \"node tools/scripts/publish.mjs core\". It depends on the \"pack\" target.\n\n4. \"lint\" target: This target uses the \"@nrwl/linter:eslint\" executor to lint the project.

It is used to configure the TypeScript compiler for the farfetched project. \n\nThe `extends` property specifies that this configuration file extends another configuration file located at `../../tsconfig.base.json`. This means that the settings defined in `tsconfig.base.json` will be inherited by this configuration file.\n\nThe `compilerOptions` property is an object that contains various settings for the TypeScript compiler. Here are the explanations for each setting:\n\n- `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`: When set to `true`, this option enforces consistent casing of file names. This means that if a file is referenced with a different casing than its actual file name, the compiler will throw an error.\n\n- `strict`: When set to `true`, this option enables strict type checking in TypeScript. It enforces stricter rules and helps catch potential errors at compile-time.\n\n- `noImplicitOverride`: When set to `true`, this option prevents implicit overriding of methods in subclasses. It ensures that methods in subclasses explicitly override methods in their parent classes.\n\n- `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`: When set to `true`, this option disallows accessing properties using an index signature. It helps prevent potential runtime errors by enforcing explicit property access.\n\n- `noImplicitReturns`: When set to `true`, this option ensures that all code paths in functions have a return statement. It helps catch potential errors where a function may not return a value in all cases.\n\n- `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`: When set to `true`, this option prevents fallthrough cases in switch statements. It enforces that each case in a switch statement ends with a `break` statement or a `return` statement.\n\n- `declaration`: When set to `true`, this option generates corresponding `.d.ts` declaration files for the TypeScript code. These declaration files provide type information for external code that uses the TypeScript code.\n\nThe `files` property is an empty array, which means that no specific files are included in the compilation process. The `include` property is an array of file patterns that specifies which files should be included in the compilation process. In this case, all `.js` and `.ts` files in the project will be included.\n\nOverall, this configuration file ensures that the TypeScript compiler is configured with strict type checking and other helpful options to catch potential errors at compile-time.

The `defineConfig` function is then called with an object as its argument, which contains two properties: `test` and `plugins`.\n\nThe `test` property is an object that contains a nested property called `typecheck`. This property is an object itself and has a property called `ignoreSourceErrors` set to `true`. This configuration suggests that the code is being tested and type checking is being performed, but any source errors should be ignored during the type checking process.\n\nThe `plugins` property is an array that contains a single element, which is the `tsconfigPaths` plugin. This plugin is used to resolve module imports using the paths defined in the TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`). It allows for more flexible and customizable module resolution in the project.\n\nOverall, this configuration file sets up the necessary configurations for the farfetched project's testing and module resolution. It ensures that type checking is performed during testing but ignores any source errors. Additionally, it enables the `tsconfigPaths` plugin to resolve module imports using the paths defined in the TypeScript configuration file.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project by importing and using the `defineConfig` function from this configuration file. For example, in other parts of the project, the `defineConfig` function can be called with different configurations to customize the behavior of the project's testing and module resolution. Here's an example of how this code can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { defineConfig } from 'farfetched/config';\n\nconst customConfig = defineConfig({\n  test: { typecheck: { ignoreSourceErrors: false } },\n  plugins: [/* other plugins */],\n});\n\n// Use the custom configuration in the project\n// ...\n```\n\nIn this example, a custom configuration is created by calling the `defineConfig` function with different properties and values.

The purpose of this code is to provide a caching mechanism for queries made in the project.\n\nThe `cache` function is the main entry point of this module. It takes a `query` parameter, which represents a query object, and an optional `rawParams` parameter, which is an object containing cache-related parameters. The function sets up various effects and data sources to handle caching operations for the given query.\n\nInside the `cache` function, the `adapter`, `staleAfter`, and `purge` parameters are extracted from the `rawParams` object using destructuring assignment. If `adapter` is not provided, it defaults to an in-memory cache adapter.\n\nThe `id` variable is assigned the unique identifier of the query using the `queryUniqId` function.\n\nThe `sourcedReaders` variable is assigned an array of sourced readers created from the low-level API of the query. These sourced readers are responsible for fetching data from the query's sources.\n\nThe `readAllSourcedFx` effect is created to asynchronously execute all the sourced readers and return their results as an array.\n\nThe `unsetFx`, `setFx`, and `getFx` effects are created to handle the unset, set, and get operations on the cache adapter, respectively. These effects use the `readAllSourcedFx` effect to fetch the necessary data for cache key generation and interact with the cache adapter accordingly.\n\nThe `cacheDatSource` object is created to define the data source for the cache. It contains three properties: `name`, `get`, and `set`. These properties define the name of the data source, the effect to get data from the cache, and the effect to set data in the cache, respectively.\n\nFinally, the `cacheDatSource` object is added to the `dataSources` array of the query's low-level API. This ensures that the cache data source is used when executing the query.\n\nAdditionally, if a `purge` event is provided, a `sample` function is used to trigger the `purge` effect on the cache adapter instance when the `purge` event occurs.\n\nOverall, this code provides a caching mechanism for queries in the \"farfetched\" project.

What does the `staleAfter` parameter do?\n- The `staleAfter` parameter specifies a time duration after which a cached value is considered stale. If the `staleAfter` value is provided, the function checks if the cached value's timestamp plus the `staleAfter` duration is less than or equal to the current time to determine if the value is stale.\n\n3. How are cache operations (get, set, unset) attached to the cache adapter instance?\n- The cache operations (get, set, unset) are attached to the cache adapter instance using the `attach` function. The `attach` function takes the cache adapter instance as the source and maps the required parameters and effects for each cache operation."

The function first calls the `stableStringify` function from the `stable_stringify` module, passing in the `params`, `sources`, and `sid` properties. The `stableStringify` function converts the object into a stable string representation.

                  "summary": "The code provided is a part of the \"farfetched\" project and contains functions and types related to updating and managing queries and mutations. \n\nThe `update` function is the main function in this code. It takes a query and an object containing a mutation and rules for handling the success and failure of the mutation. The purpose of this function is to update the query state based on the result of the mutation and apply any necessary refetching logic.\n\nHere is an example of how the `update` function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { update } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst query = ...; // define your query\nconst mutation = ...; // define your mutation\nconst rules = {\n  success: ... // define a rule for handling the success of the mutation\n  failure: ... // define a rule for handling the failure of the mutation (optional)\n};\n\nupdate(query, { on: mutation, by: rules });\n```\n\nInside the `update` function, several events and splits are created to handle the different scenarios. The `fillQueryData` and `fillQueryError` events are used to fill the query data and error respectively. The `split` function is used to split the source based on the result of the mutation and apply the appropriate rule. If the rule returns a non-empty result, the `fillQueryData` event is triggered, otherwise the `fillQueryError` event is triggered.\n\nAfter filling the query data or error, the `sample` function is used to push the data or error to the query's low-level API. This allows the query to update its state and trigger any subscribed callbacks.\n\nThe code also includes logic for refetching. The `shouldRefetch` and `shouldNotRefetch` splits are used to determine whether a refetch is needed based on the `refetch` property in the payload of the `fillQueryData` and `fillQueryError` events. If a refetch is needed, the `revalidate` method of the query's low-level API is called with the appropriate parameters.\n\nThe `queryState` function is a helper function that creates a store representing the state of the query. It combines the query's data, parameters, error, and failed status into a single object and returns a store that updates whenever any of these values change.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to update and manage queries and mutations in the \"farfetched\" project. It handles the success and failure of mutations, updates the query state, and allows for refetching when necessary.",

What is the purpose of the `fillQueryData` and `fillQueryError` events?\n- The `fillQueryData` event is used to fill the query state with the result of a successful mutation, while the `fillQueryError` event is used to fill the query state with the error of a failed mutation.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `shouldRefetch` and `shouldNotRefetch` splits?\n- The `shouldRefetch` split is used to determine if a query should be refetched based on the `refetch` property in the payload of the `fillQueryData` or `fillQueryError` events. The `shouldNotRefetch` split is used to determine if a query should not be refetched."

The `cache.ts` module sets up a caching mechanism for queries, with parameters for the adapter, staleness, and purge strategy. It uses the `queryUniqId` function from the `key.ts` module to assign a unique identifier to each query. The `key.ts` module provides functions for generating unique keys based on the properties of a query object. This efficient caching mechanism helps avoid unnecessary data duplication and improve performance.\n\n```typescript\nconst cacheResult = cache(query, { adapter: 'memory', staleAfter: 60, purge: 'event' });\nconst key = createKey({ sid: '123', params: ['param1', 'param2'], sources: ['source1', 'source2'] });\nconst uniqId = queryUniqId({ __: { meta: { sid: '123', name: 'query1' } } });\n```\n\nThe `libs` subfolder's content is not provided, hence a detailed explanation cannot be given.
