  "summary": "The code provided is a module export statement that exports a function called `ioTsContract` from a file located at `farfetched/src/contract`. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to make the `ioTsContract` function available for use in other parts of the project. This function likely plays a role in defining and validating data contracts using the io-ts library.\n\nThe `ioTsContract` function is likely used to define data contracts using the io-ts library. The io-ts library provides a way to define runtime type validations for JavaScript objects. These validations can be used to ensure that data passed into a function or returned from a function meets certain criteria.\n\nHere is an example of how the `ioTsContract` function might be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { ioTsContract } from 'farfetched';\n\n// Define a contract for a user object\nconst userContract = ioTsContract({\n  name: ioTs.string,\n  age: ioTs.number,\n  email: ioTs.string,\n});\n\n// Validate user data\nconst userData = {\n  name: 'John Doe',\n  age: 30,\n  email: 'johndoe@example.com',\n};\n\nconst validationResult = userContract.decode(userData);\n\nif (validationResult.isRight()) {\n  // Data is valid\n  const user = validationResult.value;\n  // Do something with the user object\n} else {\n  // Data is invalid\n  const errors = validationResult.value;\n  // Handle validation errors\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ioTsContract` function is used to define a contract for a user object. The contract specifies that the user object should have a `name` property of type string, an `age` property of type number, and an `email` property of type string.\n\nThe `ioTsContract` function is then used to validate a user object against the defined contract. If the user object passes the validation, it can be used in the application. If the user object fails the validation, the validation errors can be handled appropriately.\n\nOverall, the code provided is a module export statement that makes the `ioTsContract` function available for use in other parts of the project. This function likely plays a role in defining and validating data contracts using the io-ts library.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `ioTsContract` function?**\nThe `ioTsContract` function is exported from the `./src/contract` file, but its purpose is not clear from this code snippet. \n\n2. **What does the `ioTsContract` function expect as input?**\nThe code snippet does not provide any information about the expected input of the `ioTsContract` function. It would be helpful to know what arguments or parameters this function requires.\n\n3. **What does the `ioTsContract` function return?**\nThe code snippet does not show what the `ioTsContract` function returns. It would be useful to know the expected return value or side effects of calling this function."
