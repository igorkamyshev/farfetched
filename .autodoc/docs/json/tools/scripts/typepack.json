  "summary": "The purpose of this code is to generate an ES module bundle from TypeScript declaration files (`index.d.ts`) for a specific package in the `dist` directory of the project. It uses the Rollup bundler and several other Node.js modules to achieve this.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. The code imports necessary modules from Node.js and other dependencies:\n   - `path` module from Node.js to handle file paths\n   - `parseArgs` function from the `util` module in Node.js to parse command-line arguments\n   - `rmdir` function from the `fs/promises` module in Node.js to remove directories\n   - `readCachedProjectGraph` function from the `@nrwl/devkit` package to read the project graph\n   - `dts` plugin from the `rollup-plugin-dts` package to process TypeScript declaration files\n   - `rollup` function from the `rollup` package to create a Rollup bundle\n\n2. The code parses command-line arguments using `parseArgs` and retrieves the value of the `package` option.\n\n3. It constructs the input and output file paths based on the `package` value:\n   - `inputDir` is set to the path `dist/packages/<package>`\n   - `inputFile` is set to the path `dist/packages/<package>/index.d.ts`\n   - `outputFile` is set to the same path as `inputFile`\n\n4. It retrieves the list of external dependencies by filtering the project graph and extracting the names of libraries (`node.type === 'lib'`) in the `@farfetched` namespace.\n\n5. It creates a Rollup bundle by calling the `rollup` function with the following options:\n   - `input` is set to `inputFile`\n   - `plugins` is an array containing the `dts` plugin\n   - `external` is set to the list of external dependencies\n\n6. It writes the bundle to the output file using the `write` method of the bundle object.\n\n7. It removes the `src` directory within the input directory using the `rmdir` function.\n\nOverall, this code takes a specific package's TypeScript declaration file, processes it with Rollup and the `dts` plugin, and generates an ES module bundle. The resulting bundle is written to the same location as the input file, and the `src` directory within the input directory is removed. This code can be used as part of a build process to generate bundled declaration files for individual packages in the larger project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `parseArgs` function and how is it used in this code?\n- The `parseArgs` function is used to parse command line arguments. In this code, it is used to parse the `package` option from the command line arguments.\n\n2. What is the role of the `rollup-plugin-dts` plugin and why is it used in this code?\n- The `rollup-plugin-dts` plugin is used to generate TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts) from the input file. It is used in this code to generate the declaration file for the specified package.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `rmdir` function and why is it used in this code?\n- The `rmdir` function is used to remove a directory. In this code, it is used to remove the `src` directory within the `inputDir` directory."
