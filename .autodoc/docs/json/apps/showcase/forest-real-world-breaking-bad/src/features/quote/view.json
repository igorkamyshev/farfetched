  "summary": "The code provided is a module that defines a view component called `RandomQuotesView`. This component is responsible for rendering a form that allows the user to load and display a list of random quotes. The component uses the `effector` and `forest` libraries for state management and UI rendering, respectively.\n\nThe `RandomQuotesView` function initializes the necessary events and stores for managing the state of the component. It creates an event called `changeAmount` which is used to update the amount of quotes to be loaded. The amount is stored in a store called `$amount`, which is initialized with a default value of 1.\n\nThe component also defines an event called `loadQuotes`, which is triggered when the form is submitted. This event samples the current value of `$amount` and passes it as a parameter to the `randomQuotesQuery.start` event. This event is responsible for fetching the random quotes from the server.\n\nThe component then renders a form using the `h` function from the `forest` library. The form contains an input field for specifying the amount of quotes to load, a label, and a submit button. The value of the input field is bound to the `$amount` store, and any changes to the input field trigger the `changeAmount` event.\n\nWhen the form is submitted, the `loadQuotes` event is triggered, which in turn triggers the `randomQuotesQuery.start` event with the sampled amount of quotes. The quotes are fetched from the server and stored in the `randomQuotesQuery.$data` store.\n\nThe component also defines a route using the `route` function from the `forest` library. This route listens to changes in the `randomQuotesQuery.$data` store and renders the list of quotes if there are any. The list is rendered as an ordered list (`ol`), with each quote item rendered as a list item (`li`). The author and quote values are extracted from each quote item using the `remap` function, and then rendered using the `val` function.\n\nIn summary, the `RandomQuotesView` component allows the user to load and display a list of random quotes. The user can specify the amount of quotes to load through an input field, and the quotes are fetched from the server and rendered in a list. This component can be used as part of a larger project that requires a random quotes feature.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `randomQuotesQuery` and how is it used in this code?\n- The `randomQuotesQuery` is likely a query function that retrieves random quotes. It is used as the source for the `route` function and the `list` function to display the random quotes.\n\n2. How does the `changeAmount` event and `$amount` store work together?\n- The `changeAmount` event is triggered when the input value for the amount changes. It updates the `$amount` store with the new value, which is then used as the source for the `sample` function to determine the amount of random quotes to load.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `extractNumber` function and how is it used?\n- The `extractNumber` function is likely used to extract the numeric value from the input event. It is used as a handler for the `input` event of the input element, and is passed to the `changeAmount.prepend` function to transform the input event before it is passed to the `changeAmount` event."
