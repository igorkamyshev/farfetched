  "summary": "The code provided is a module that is part of the larger farfetched project. This module is responsible for creating a JSON query to retrieve random quotes from the Breaking Bad Quotes API. \n\nThe module imports several functions and types from different libraries and modules. It imports the `createJsonQuery` and `declareParams` functions from the `@farfetched/core` module, the `runtypeContract` function from the `@farfetched/runtypes` module, and the `Array` type from the `runtypes` library. It also imports the `Quote` type from a local `contract` module.\n\nThe `randomQuotesQuery` constant is exported from this module. It is a function that creates a JSON query for retrieving random quotes. The function takes an object as an argument, which includes the `amount` parameter. The `amount` parameter specifies the number of random quotes to retrieve.\n\nThe `randomQuotesQuery` function uses the `createJsonQuery` function to define the JSON query. It specifies the `params` as an object with a single property `amount`, which is declared using the `declareParams` function. The `initialData` is set to an empty array.\n\nThe `request` property of the JSON query specifies the HTTP method as `GET` and the URL as a template string. The URL is constructed using the `amount` parameter to specify the number of quotes to retrieve from the Breaking Bad Quotes API.\n\nThe `response` property of the JSON query specifies the contract for the response data. It uses the `runtypeContract` function to define the contract as an array of `Quote` objects.\n\nOverall, this module provides a convenient way to create a JSON query for retrieving random quotes from the Breaking Bad Quotes API. It abstracts away the details of constructing the query and provides a contract for the response data. This module can be used in the larger farfetched project to fetch random quotes and handle the response data in a structured manner.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `createJsonQuery` function and how does it work?\n- The `createJsonQuery` function is used to create a JSON query for making HTTP requests. It takes in an object with parameters such as `params`, `initialData`, `request`, and `response` to configure the query.\n\n2. What is the role of the `runtypeContract` function and how is it used in this code?\n- The `runtypeContract` function is used to define a contract for validating the response data. In this code, it is used to define a contract for an array of `Quote` objects.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `randomQuotesQuery` constant and how is it used?\n- The `randomQuotesQuery` constant is a JSON query object that is configured to make a GET request to the Breaking Bad Quotes API. It takes in a parameter `amount` and returns an array of `Quote` objects as the response data. It can be used to fetch random quotes from the API by providing the desired amount."
