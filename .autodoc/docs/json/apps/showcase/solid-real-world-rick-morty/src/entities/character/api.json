  "summary": "The code provided is a function called `characterUrl` that is used to generate URLs for retrieving character data from the Rick and Morty API. The function has three different overloads, each with a different set of parameters.\n\nThe first overload is a function signature without any parameters. It returns a string representing the base URL for retrieving character data from the API: `https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character`.\n\nThe second overload is a function signature that takes an object parameter with a property `id` of type `TId`. It returns a string representing the URL for retrieving character data for a specific character with the given `id`. The `id` is interpolated into the URL: `https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/${params.id}`.\n\nThe third overload is a function signature that takes an object parameter with a property `ids` of type `TId[]`. It returns a string representing the URL for retrieving character data for multiple characters with the given `ids`. The `ids` are joined with commas and interpolated into the URL: `https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/[${params.ids.join(',')}]`.\n\nThe function uses optional chaining (`params?.ids` and `params?.id`) to check if the `ids` or `id` properties exist in the `params` object before accessing them. If `params.ids` exists, it means that the third overload was called and the function returns the URL for retrieving data for multiple characters. If `params.id` exists, it means that the second overload was called and the function returns the URL for retrieving data for a single character. If neither `params.ids` nor `params.id` exist, it means that the first overload was called and the function returns the base URL for retrieving character data.\n\nThis function can be used in the larger project to easily generate the appropriate URLs for retrieving character data from the Rick and Morty API. Developers can call the function with different combinations of parameters to retrieve data for a single character, multiple characters, or all characters. Here are some examples:\n\n```javascript\nconst url1 = characterUrl(); // returns \"https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character\"\nconst url2 = characterUrl({ id: 1 }); // returns \"https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/1\"\nconst url3 = characterUrl({ ids: [1, 2, 3] }); // returns \"https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/[1,2,3]\"\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `TId` import from `'../../shared/id'`?\n- The smart developer might want to know what type of data the `TId` represents and how it is used in the code.\n\n2. What are the possible inputs for the `characterUrl` function?\n- The smart developer might want to know the different ways the `characterUrl` function can be called and what parameters it accepts.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `if` statements in the `characterUrl` function?\n- The smart developer might want to understand the logic behind the `if` statements and how they determine the URL that is returned by the function."
