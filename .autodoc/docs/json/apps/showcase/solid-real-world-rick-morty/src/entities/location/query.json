  "summary": "The code provided is a part of the farfetched project and is located in the `farfetched` directory. It imports several modules and defines a function called `locationQuery`. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to create a JSON query for retrieving location data from an API. It is designed to be used in the larger project to fetch location information based on a given ID.\n\nThe code imports two functions, `createJsonQuery` and `declareParams`, from the `@farfetched/core` module. It also imports a function called `runtypeContract` from the `@farfetched/runtypes` module. Additionally, it imports the `TId` type from the `../../shared/id` module and the `locationUrl` function and `Location` type from the `./api` and `./contract` modules respectively.\n\nThe `locationQuery` function is defined using the `createJsonQuery` function. It takes an object as an argument with three properties: `params`, `request`, and `response`. \n\nThe `params` property is defined using the `declareParams` function and specifies that the `id` parameter should be of type `TId`.\n\nThe `request` property is an object that specifies the URL and method for the API request. The URL is determined by the `locationUrl` function, which takes the `id` parameter as an argument. The method is set to 'GET'.\n\nThe `response` property specifies the contract for the response data. It uses the `runtypeContract` function to define the contract as the `Location` type.\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to create a JSON query for fetching location data from an API. It abstracts away the details of constructing the query and handling the response, making it easier to use in the larger project. Here is an example of how the `locationQuery` function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nconst locationData = await locationQuery({ id: '123' });\nconsole.log(locationData);\n```\n\nIn this example, the `locationQuery` function is called with an object containing the `id` parameter. The function sends a GET request to the API using the specified URL and retrieves the location data. The data is then logged to the console.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `createJsonQuery` function and how does it work?\n- The `createJsonQuery` function is used to create a JSON query for making HTTP requests. It takes in an object with parameters, request details, and response details to define the query.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `declareParams` function and how is it used in this code?\n- The `declareParams` function is used to declare the parameters for the JSON query. In this code, it is used to declare the `id` parameter for the `locationQuery` query.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `runtypeContract` function and how is it used in this code?\n- The `runtypeContract` function is used to define a contract for the response of the JSON query. In this code, it is used to define the contract for the `Location` response type."
