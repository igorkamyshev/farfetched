  "summary": "The code provided is a module that exports a React component called `EpisodesListPage`. This component is responsible for rendering a list of episodes and providing pagination functionality.\n\nThe component imports several dependencies, including functions and components from various libraries. These dependencies are used to create a query resource, handle routing, manage state, and render components.\n\nThe `EpisodesListPage` component starts by defining a state variable `currentPage` using the `useUnit` hook from the `effector-solid` library. This state variable is initialized with the value of `$currentPage`, which is likely a shared state managed by the `model` module.\n\nNext, the component calls the `createQueryResource` function from the `@farfetched/solid` library to create a query resource. This query resource is likely responsible for fetching the list of episodes from an external data source.\n\nThe component then renders a heading element `<h1>` with the text \"Episodes\". It also wraps the rest of the content in a `<Suspense>` component, which displays a fallback message \"Loading...\" while the data is being fetched.\n\nInside the `<Suspense>` component, the component uses the `<Show>` component from the `solid-js` library to conditionally render the content based on the result of the `data` query resource. If the data is available, it renders an ordered list `<ol>`.\n\nWithin the `<ol>`, the component uses the `<For>` component from the `solid-js` library to iterate over the `results` array obtained from the `data` query resource. For each episode in the `results` array, it renders a list item `<li>` with a link to the episode's details page. The link is created using the `Link` component from the `atomic-router-solid` library and the `episodeRoute` route.\n\nAfter rendering the list of episodes, the component renders a `Pagination` component. This component receives the `currentPage` state variable, the `info` object from the `data` query resource, and the `episodeListRoute` route as props. The `Pagination` component is likely responsible for rendering pagination controls and handling navigation to different pages of the episode list.\n\nOverall, the `EpisodesListPage` component is a high-level component that fetches a list of episodes, renders them in a list, and provides pagination functionality. It can be used as a page component in a larger project to display and navigate through a collection of episodes.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `createQueryResource` function from `@farfetched/solid` and how is it used in this code? \n- The smart developer might want to know how the `createQueryResource` function works and what it does with the `episodesQuery` data.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `Pagination` component and how is it used in this code? \n- The smart developer might want to understand how the `Pagination` component is implemented and how it interacts with the `currentPage`, `info`, and `episodeListRoute` variables.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Suspense` and `Show` components from `solid-js` and how are they used in this code? \n- The smart developer might want to know how the `Suspense` and `Show` components are used to handle asynchronous data loading and conditional rendering in this code."
