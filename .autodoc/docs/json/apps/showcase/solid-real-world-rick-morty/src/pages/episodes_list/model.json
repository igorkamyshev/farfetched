  "summary": "The code provided is a module that is part of the larger farfetched project. The purpose of this code is to handle the querying of episodes for a specific page in the project.\n\nThe code begins by importing the `attachOperation` function from the `@farfetched/core` module, as well as the `sample` function from the `effector` module. It also imports the `episodeListRoute` and `episodePageQuery` functions from the `../../entities/episode` module.\n\nThe `attachOperation` function is then used to create a new function called `episodesQuery`, which is a modified version of the `episodePageQuery` function. This modified function is used to query episodes for a specific page.\n\nNext, the code creates a new store called `$currentPage` using the `episodeListRoute.$params` store. The `$currentPage` store maps over the `params` object and extracts the `page` property. If the `page` property is not present, it defaults to 1.\n\nFinally, the `sample` function is used to create a new sample unit. This sample unit is triggered whenever either the `episodeListRoute.opened` or `episodeListRoute.updated` events occur. It takes the `$currentPage` store as the source and the `episodesQuery.start` function as the target. This means that whenever the `episodeListRoute` is opened or updated, the `episodesQuery.start` function will be called with the current page as the argument.\n\nThe code then exports the `$currentPage` store and the `episodesQuery` function, making them available for use in other parts of the project.\n\nIn the larger farfetched project, this code is likely used to handle the querying of episodes for a specific page. It provides a way to retrieve the current page from the `episodeListRoute` and pass it to the `episodesQuery` function to initiate the query. This allows the project to display the appropriate episodes based on the current page.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `attachOperation` function from `@farfetched/core`?**\nThe `attachOperation` function is used to attach an operation to a specific query or mutation. It is likely used in this code to attach the `episodePageQuery` operation to the `episodesQuery` variable.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `sample` function from `effector`?**\nThe `sample` function is used to create a sample of a source signal at the moment when a clock signal emits. In this code, it is used to sample the `page` value from the `$currentPage` signal when either `episodeListRoute.opened` or `episodeListRoute.updated` signals emit, and then pass it as the source to the `episodesQuery.start` signal.\n\n3. **What are the possible values of the `page` parameter in the `episodeListRoute.$params` signal?**\nThe `page` parameter in the `episodeListRoute.$params` signal can have any value, but if it is not provided or is `null`, the `??` operator is used to default it to `1`."
