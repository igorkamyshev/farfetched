  "summary": "The code provided is a module export statement that exports the `EpisodePage` component from the `view` file. This code is part of the larger farfetched project and is used to organize and manage the components and views within the project.\n\nThe `EpisodePage` component is likely a React component that represents a page or view for displaying information about a specific episode. It may contain various UI elements and logic for fetching and rendering episode data.\n\nBy exporting the `EpisodePage` component, other files within the farfetched project can import and use this component. This allows for code reusability and modularity, as the `EpisodePage` component can be easily imported and integrated into other parts of the project.\n\nFor example, in another file within the farfetched project, the `EpisodePage` component can be imported and used like this:\n\n```javascript\nimport { EpisodePage } from 'farfetched';\n\n// Use the EpisodePage component\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Farfetched App</h1>\n      <EpisodePage />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `EpisodePage` component is imported from the `farfetched` module and rendered within the `App` component. This allows the `EpisodePage` component to be displayed as part of the larger application.\n\nOverall, this code is a simple module export statement that exports the `EpisodePage` component from the `view` file. It is used to make the `EpisodePage` component accessible and reusable within the farfetched project.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `EpisodePage` component?**\nThe `EpisodePage` component is exported from the `view` file, but it is not clear what functionality or UI it provides within the project.\n\n2. **Are there any other components or functions being exported from the `view` file?**\nThe code only shows the export of the `EpisodePage` component, but it is possible that there are other exports from the `view` file that are not shown.\n\n3. **Where is the `view` file located within the project directory structure?**\nThe code only provides the relative path `./view`, but it does not specify the exact location of the `view` file within the `farfetched` project."
