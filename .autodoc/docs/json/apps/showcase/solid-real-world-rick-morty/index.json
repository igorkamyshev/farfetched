  "summary": "The code provided is an HTML file that serves as the entry point for a web application. It is part of the larger \"farfetched\" project. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to define the structure and initial content of the web page. It includes the necessary HTML tags and elements to create a basic webpage layout. \n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This is the document type declaration and specifies that the document is an HTML5 document.\n- `<html lang=\"en\">`: This tag defines the root element of the HTML document and specifies the language of the document (English in this case).\n- `<head>`: This tag contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the character encoding, title, and other metadata.\n- `<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />`: This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the document (UTF-8 in this case).\n- `<title>Rick, Morty and Farfetched</title>`: This tag sets the title of the webpage, which will be displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.\n- `<base href=\"/\" />`: This tag specifies the base URL for all relative URLs within the document.\n- `<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />`: This meta tag sets the viewport properties for the webpage, ensuring that it is displayed properly on different devices and screen sizes.\n- `<link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"favicon.ico\" />`: This link tag specifies the favicon (shortcut icon) for the webpage, which is displayed in the browser's tab or bookmark bar.\n- `<body>`: This tag contains the visible content of the webpage.\n- `<div id=\"root\"></div>`: This div element with the id \"root\" is a placeholder for the main content of the webpage. It can be used by JavaScript code to dynamically render and update the content.\n- `<script type=\"module\" src=\"/src/main.tsx\"></script>`: This script tag includes an external JavaScript file called \"main.tsx\" using the \"module\" type. This file is located in the \"/src\" directory of the project. It is likely that this file contains the main logic and functionality of the web application, such as rendering components and handling user interactions.\n\nIn summary, this code sets up the basic structure and initial content of the webpage, and includes a JavaScript file that is responsible for the main functionality of the web application.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `base` tag?**\nThe `base` tag is used to specify the base URL for all relative URLs in the document. It helps in resolving relative URLs correctly.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `viewport` meta tag?**\nThe `viewport` meta tag is used to control the layout and scaling of the webpage on different devices. It ensures that the webpage is displayed properly on various screen sizes.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `type=\"module\"` attribute in the script tag?**\nThe `type=\"module\"` attribute indicates that the script is a JavaScript module. It allows the use of ES modules, which provide a way to organize and share JavaScript code in separate files."
