  "summary": "The code provided is a module that exports two functions: `pokemonUrl` and `speciesUrl`. These functions are used to generate URLs for making API requests to the PokeAPI.\n\nThe `pokemonUrl` function has two overloaded signatures. The first signature takes no parameters and returns a string representing the base URL for retrieving Pokemon data from the PokeAPI. The second signature takes an object parameter with an `id` property of type `TId` (which is imported from the `../../shared/id` module) and returns a string representing the URL for retrieving data of a specific Pokemon with the given ID.\n\nHere's an example of how the `pokemonUrl` function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { pokemonUrl } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst baseUrl = pokemonUrl(); // returns 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon'\nconst specificUrl = pokemonUrl({ id: 25 }); // returns 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/25'\n```\n\nSimilarly, the `speciesUrl` function also has two overloaded signatures. The first signature takes no parameters and returns a string representing the base URL for retrieving Pokemon species data from the PokeAPI. The second signature takes an object parameter with an `id` property of type `TId` and returns a string representing the URL for retrieving data of a specific Pokemon species with the given ID.\n\nHere's an example of how the `speciesUrl` function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { speciesUrl } from 'farfetched';\n\nconst baseUrl = speciesUrl(); // returns 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species'\nconst specificUrl = speciesUrl({ id: 25 }); // returns 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/25'\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to generate the URLs needed to make API requests to the PokeAPI for retrieving Pokemon and Pokemon species data. It abstracts away the construction of the URLs and allows the user to easily generate the appropriate URL based on their needs.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `TId` import from `'../../shared/id'`?\n- The smart developer might want to know what type of data the `TId` represents and how it is used in the code.\n\n2. What is the difference between the `pokemonUrl` and `speciesUrl` functions?\n- The smart developer might want to understand the distinction between these two functions and why they have separate implementations.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the optional `params` parameter in the `pokemonUrl` and `speciesUrl` functions?\n- The smart developer might want to know when and how the `params` parameter is used and what values it can accept."
