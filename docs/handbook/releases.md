# Releases policy

The main goal of Farfetched is to **make developer experience better**, as a part of this strategy we are committing to some rules of Farfetched releases.

## 0.x.x releases

Until API would be stabilized, we are going to release versions 0.x.x as pre-releases. Each version can include breaking changes, but it will be soundness.

## Stable releases

After the first stable release, we will maintain backward compatibility for 2 years. Of course, Farfetched can introduce some breaking changes. We are committing that any breaking change will be prepended by deprecation warning at least for one year.
