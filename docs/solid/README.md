## Methods

### `createQueryResource(query)`

It is analogue of SoildJS [`createResource`](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#createresource), but uses [_Query_](../core/primitives/query.md) as a source and fetcher.

```tsx
function UserProfile() {
  const { data: user } = createQueryResource(userQuery);

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Loader />}>
      <section>
        <p>{user().name}</p>
        <p>{user().email}</p>
      </section>
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```
