# Barrier API

:::tip You will learn

- How to postpone execution of a [_Query_](/api/primitives/query) or [_Mutation_](/api/primitives/mutation) until some conditions are met
- How to perform some actions before the execution of a [_Query_](/api/primitives/query) or [_Mutation_](/api/primitives/mutation)

:::

In the previous chapters, we learned how to fetch data from the server and how to display it. Now let us talk about suspending the execution of [_Queries_](/api/primitives/query) and [_Mutations_](/api/primitives/mutation) based on some criteria.

This topic is quite practical, so we suggest learning it by examples:

1. [How to check if the users token is valid before data fetching and perform some actions if it is not](/recipes/auth_token)
2. [How to pause the execution of a _Query_ until the user accepts term of use](/recipes/terms_of_use)

If you want to learn more about the Barrier API, you can read the [API reference](/api/primitives/barrier).
