# Continues adoption

This tutorial describes how to add Farfetched to an existing application uses _Effects_ for data fetching step by step without rewriting big parts of the codebase.

::: tip
This tutorial is not a replacement for the [Thorough Tutorial](/tutorial/install) which is a better starting point for learning Farfetched. Furthermore, it is assumed that you have read [Thorough Tutorial](/tutorial/install) and know the basics of Farfetched.

Farfetched is built with continues adoption in mind, so there are straightforward steps to add it to an existing application and embrace its benefits:

1. Wrap existing data fetching _Effects_ to _Queries_ and _Mutations_
2. Replace existing add-ons with Farfetched operators like `retry`, `cache` or `connectQuery`
3. Add strict _Contracts_ to server responses
4. Migrate to specific factories like `createJsonQuery` and `createJsonMutation`
5. Apply declarative approach with Trigger API and `keepFresh` operator
