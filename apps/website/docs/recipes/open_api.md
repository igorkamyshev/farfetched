# Code generation with OpenAPI

Farfetched itself does not have any code generation capabilities. However, it is possible to use the OpenAPI specification (and its implementation Swagger) to generate code for the client with external open-source tools.

In this recipe, we will use the [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/openapi/openapi) with a special [preset for Effector](https://github.com/openapi/preset-effector).

## Preparations

1. Install the OpenAPI Generator and the Effector preset:

::: code-group

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add --save-dev openapi@^1.0.0 openapi-preset-effector typed-contracts
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn add --dev openapi@^1.0.0 openapi-preset-effector typed-contracts
```

```sh [npm]
npm install --dev openapi@^1.0.0 openapi-preset-effector typed-contracts
```

:::

:::warning
`openapi-preset-effector` supports only [`typed-contracts`](https://github.com/bigslycat/typed-contracts) for now, but integrations for [`runtypes`](https://github.com/openapi/preset-effector/issues/12), [`io-ts`](https://github.com/openapi/preset-effector/issues/13) and [`superstruct`](https://github.com/openapi/preset-effector/issues/19) on their ways.

To prevent using many contract systems in your project, we recommend using `typed-contracts` across the whole project. Farfetched supports it out of the box, read more the API reference for [`@farfetched/typed-contracts`](/api/contracts/typed-contracts).
:::

2. Create base [_Effect_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/effect/) that will be used in the generated code, put it in the `./src/api/shared/request.ts` file. In general, it has to be any [_Effect_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/effect/) with the following signature:

```ts
export interface Request {
  path: string;
  method: string;
  body?: object | null | void;
  query?: Record<string, string>;
  headers?: Record<string, string>;
  cookies?: string;
}

export interface Answer {
  ok: boolean;
  body: unknown;
  status: number;
  headers: Record<string, string>;
}

export const requestFx = createEffect<Request, Answer, Answer>({
  handler: async (request) => {
    // ...
  },
});
```

:::tip
The full code of the file is out of scope of this recipe, but you can find it in the [example repository](https://github.com/accesso-app/frontend/blob/master/src/shared/api/request/client.ts).
:::

3. Create a configuration file `openapi.config.js` in the root of your project with the following contents:

```js
module.exports = {
  file: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/main/examples/v2.0/json/petstore-minimal.json',
  outputDir: './src/api/shared',
  presets: [
    [
      'openapi-preset-effector',
      {
        effectorImport: 'effector',
        requestName: 'fetchFx',
        requestPath: './request',
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

:::tip
This recipe is based on the official example from the OpenAPI specification repository â€” [perstore-minimal.json](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/examples/v2.0/json/petstore-minimal.json).
:::

## Generation

You are ready to generate the code. Run the following command:

::: code-group

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm openapi
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn openapi
```

```sh [npm]
npm openapi
```

:::

The generated code will be placed in the `./src/api/shared` directory. You must not touch it, because it will be overwritten on the next generation.

## Make it farfetched

Generated code contains [_Effects_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/effect/), but Farfetched's APIs work only with [_Query_](/api/primitives/query) or [_Mutation_](/api/primitives/mutation). So, we need to wrap the generated code with Farfetched's APIs. Let's create a file `./src/api/shared/index.ts` with the following contents:

```ts
import { createQuery } from '@farfetched/core';

import { petsGet } from './swagger-petstore';

export const petsQuery = createQuery({ effect: petsGet });
```

Now, you can use `petsQuery` in your code as simple as any other [_Query_](/api/primitives/query), for example:

```ts
import { retry } from '@farfetched/core';

import { petsQuery } from './api/shared';

retry(petsQuery, {
  times: 3,
  delay: 1000,
});
```
