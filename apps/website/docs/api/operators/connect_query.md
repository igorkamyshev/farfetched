# `connectQuery`

Creates static connection between [_Queries_](../primitives/query.md). Every time when `source` [_Queries_](../primitives/query.md) successfully done, `target` [_Query_](../primitives/query.md) will start with a data from `source` as parameters.

## Formulae

### `connectQuery({ source, target })`

This form is used for `target` [_Query_](../primitives/query.md) without parameters. It does not pass any data to `target`.

```ts
const languagesQuery: Query<unknown, unknown, unknown>;
const blocksQuery: Query<unknown, unknown, unknown>;

const contentQuery: Query<void, unknown, unknown>;

connectQuery({
  source: { language: languagesQuery, blocks: blocksQuery },
  target: contentQuery,
});
```

### `connectQuery({ source, fn, target })`

This form is used for `target` [_Query_](../primitives/query.md) with parameters. It gets data from `source`, transforms it through `fn` and uses it for `target` [_Query_](../primitives/query.md), allowed fields:

- `params` â€” data that is used to start `target` [_Query_](../primitives/query.md)

```ts
const blocksQuery: Query<unknown, string, unknown>;
const blocksQuery: Query<unknown, string[], unknown>;

const contentQuery: Query<
  { language: string; ids: string[] },
  unknown,
  unknown
>;

connectQuery({
  source: { language: languagesQuery, blocks: blocksQuery },
  fn({ language, blocks }) {
    return { params: { language, ids: blocks } };
  },
  target: contentQuery,
});
```
