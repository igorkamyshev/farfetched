# TypeScript

Farfetched is going to provide first-class support of TypeScript types. It is written in TypeScript, and it has a lot of type-tests. However, TypeScript itself does not aim for [apply a sound or "provably correct" type system](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Design-Goals#non-goals), instead it strikes a balance between correctness and productivity. So, we cannot guarantee that all the types are correct, but we are going to do our best to provide the best possible types.
