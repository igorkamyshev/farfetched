# Effector

Farfetched uses [Effector](https://effector.dev) under the hood to handle reactive states and its relations. Even if you use Farfetched without Effector, you can enjoy by its all features.

Farfetched is designed to be suitable to use with any other technology, it is not opinionated. Its public API is easily combinable with everything, the whole API based on [_Event_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/event/) and [_Store_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/store/):

- [_Event_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/event/) can be considered as callable function, so just call it.
- [_Store_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/store/) can be considered as simple observable object, so just watch it.
- [_Event_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/event/) can be considered as simple observable object as well, so you can watch it too.

However, we recommend trying [Effector](https://effector.dev) in your project because it is a lightweight and performant state manager that is UI frameworks agnostic, predictable and easy to use. It will definitely improve your developer experience.

Sometimes in the documentation, we are referring to [Effector](https://effector.dev) docs to explain some basic reactive concepts (such [_Store_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/store/) or [_Effect_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/effect/)), do not worry you do not have to read all [Effector](https://effector.dev) docs, you can just start with exploring basic concepts.
