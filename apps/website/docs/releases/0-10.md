::: details Why Namtok Than Sadet?
Namtok Than Sadet is a national park on the island Pha-ngan. This release is about timeouts, Pha-ngan is a place without time, so it is a perfect match üèù
:::

This release introduces [`timeout` operator](/api/operators/timeout) and prepares the ground for the upcoming improvements in operations cancellation. Furthermore, it includes a couple of fixes and improvements.

It includes a couple of breaking changes, so please read the migration guide carefully.

## Migration guide

### Separate [_Event_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/event/) for [_Query_](/api/primitives/query) cancelation

Cancelled [_Queries_](/api/primitives/query) were treated as failed before this release. We have added a separate [_Event_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/event/) `.aborted` to [_Query_](/api/primitives/query) to distinguish between cancelation and failure in [v0.9](/releases/0-9). In v0.10 aborting a [_Query_](/api/primitives/query) will not trigger `.finished.failure` [_Event_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/event/) anymore. Instead, it will trigger `.aborted` [_Event_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/event/) with `{ params, meta }` payload.

Furthermore, we have added a new [_Event_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/event/) `.aborted` to [_Mutation_](/api/primitives/mutation) to make it consistent with [_Query_](/api/primitives/query).

### New default for `supressIntermediateErrors` in `retry` operator

Before this release, `supressIntermediateErrors` in [`retry`](/api/operators/retry) has a `false` as a default value. Since v0.10 it has `true` as a default value. If you want to restore the previous behavior, you will have to set it to `false` explicitly.
