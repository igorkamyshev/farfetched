# v0.12 Talat Noi

The main highlights of this release are:

- [`concurrency` operator](/api/operators/concurrency) which allows you to control the concurrency of the any operation (not only created by `createJsonQuery` and `createJsonMutation`).
- Initial release of [Dev Tools interface](/tutorial/devtools) which allows you to inspect and debug operation.
