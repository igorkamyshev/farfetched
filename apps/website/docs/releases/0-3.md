# v0.3 Sirinat

The third release of Farfetched includes the most requested feature â€” operator `cache`. It allows to cache any [_Query_](/api/primitives/query) and make user interface respond immediately to the data that is already available.

It also includes a couple of minor improvements and bug fixes.

## Migration guide

### `retry`

`retry(config)` overload has been deprecated in favor of `retry(operation, config)` to support retrying of [_Mutations_](/api/primitives/mutation) as well as [_Queries_](/api/primitives/query). The old overload will be removed in the next release.

```ts
// before
retry({
  query: someQuery,
  times: 3,
  delay: 1000,
});

// after
retry(someQuery, {
  times: 3,
  delay: 1000,
});
```
