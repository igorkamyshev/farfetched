# v0.3 Sirinat

The third release of Farfetched includes the most requested feature â€” operator [`cache`](/api/operators/cache). It allows to cache any [_Query_](/api/primitives/query) and make user interface respond immediately to the data that is already available. Read more about it in the [API reference](/api/operators/cache), [tutorial](/tutorial/caching), and [deep-dive article](/recipes/cache).

```ts
import { cache, createQuery } from '@farfetched/core';

const languageQuery = createQuery({
  handler: async () => {
    const res = await fetch('/api/language');

    return res.json();
  },
});

cache(languageQuery);
```

It also includes a couple of minor improvements and bug fixes.

::: details Why Sirinat?

Sirinat National Park is quite a small park at the northwest coast of Phuket Island where Farfetched was born.

## Migration guide

### `retry`

`retry(config)` overload has been deprecated in favor of `retry(operation, config)` to support retrying of [_Mutations_](/api/primitives/mutation) as well as [_Queries_](/api/primitives/query). The old overload will be removed in the next release.

```ts
// before
retry({
  query: someQuery,
  times: 3,
  delay: 1000,
});

// after
retry(someQuery, {
  times: 3,
  delay: 1000,
});
```

### Effector 22.4

This release is compatible with Effector 22.4. If you are using Effector 22.3, you should upgrade to 22.4.
