# v0.11

This release contains a couple of breaking changes, so please read the migration guide carefully.

## Migration guide

### Use Effector v23

To use Farfetched v0.11 you need to use Effector v23 and have all related dependencies (`effector-solid`, `effector-vue`, etc.) updated. Please, refer to Effector v23 migration guide for more details.

### Delete `isAbortError`

Since [v0.10](/releases/0-10) aborted [_Queries_](/api/primitives/query) and [_Mutations_](/api/primitives/mutation) are not treated as failed anymore. So, `isAbortError` is not needed can be safely removed from your codebase.
