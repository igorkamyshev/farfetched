::: details Why Saphan Hin?
Saphan Hin is a seaside park in the Phuket Town where almost the whole 0.8 release was written. It is a great place to relax and enjoy the sea breeze ðŸŒŠ
:::

It is a quite big release with a lot of new features and improvements. The most important changes are:

- [Triggers API](/tutorial/trigger_api) to keep your data fresh
- New integration for [`typed-contracts`](/api/contracts/typed-contracts)
- Significant improvements in type inference

Furthermore, it includes a couple of minor breaking changes, so please read the migration guide carefully.

## Migration guide

### Do not use `refetch` in `@farfetched/solid`

`refetch` was deprecated in [v0.7](/releases/0-7), use `start` instead.

::: code-group

```tsx [before]
import { createQueryResource } from '@farfetched/solid';

function User() {
  const [user, { refetch }] = createQueryResource(userQuery);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={refetch}>Start query</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx [after]
import { createQueryResource } from '@farfetched/solid';

function User() {
  const [user, { start }] = createQueryResource(userQuery);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={start}>Start query</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Do not use `externalCache` adapter

`externalCache` adapter is deprecated, write your own adapter instead [by recipe](/recipes/server_cache).
