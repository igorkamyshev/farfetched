# v0.9 Cleanup

This release is technical. It includes only deletions of deprecated features and general refactoring of the API. This release intentionally does not include any new features, so you can upgrade your codebase without any pressure.

## Migration guide

There are a bunch of breaking changes, but they are all minor and should not affect your code much. Furthermore, they are the [soundness as promised](/statements/releases). Please read the migration guide carefully before upgrading.

::: tip Q: Why breaking changes is necessary now?

A: The best APIs are created on top of real cases, so we've released [v0.1 Samet Nangshe](/releases/0-1) almost a year ago to get feedback from the community and collect real use cases. We've got a lot of feedback, and now we are ready to make the API more consistent and predictable.

:::

### Do not use `externalCache` adapter

`externalCache` adapter was deprecated in [0.8](/releases/0-8), write your own adapter instead [by recipe](/recipes/server_cache).

### Read-only [_Stores_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/store/) and [_Events_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/event/)

[_Events_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/event/) `finished.*` have never been supposed to be called in application code. Now they are read-only. In case you call them, you will get a warning in console in Effector 22 and exception in Effector 23.

[_Stores_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/store/) `$data`, `$error`, `$status`, `$idle`, `$pending`, `$succeeded`, `$failed`, `$enabled` have never been supposed to be changed in application code directly. Now they are read-only. In case you change them, you will get a warning in console in Effector 22 and exception in Effector 23.

### Separate [_Event_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/event/) for [_Query_](/api/primitives/query) cancelation

Cancelled [_Queries_](/api/primitives/query) were treated as failed before this release. We have added a separate [_Event_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/event/) `.aborted` to [_Query_](/api/primitives/query) to distinguish between cancelation and failure. It is recommended to use `.aborted` instead of `.finished.failure` to handle cancelation.

:::warning
In the next release v0.10 cancelation will not be treated as failure anymore, so you will have to handle it explicitly.
:::

### `supressIntermediateErrors` in `retry` operator

Before this release, [`retry`](/api/operators/retry) operator was marking [_Query_](/api/primitives/query) as failed on every failed attempt. Since v0.9 it accepts options `supressIntermediateErrors` to overwrite this behavior. If `true`, then the [_Query_](/api/primitives/query) will not be marked as failed until the last attempt is failed.

:::warning

In the next release v0.10 `supressIntermediateErrors` will be true `true` by default. To restore the previous behavior, you will have to set it to `false` explicitly.

:::

### Re-worked [_Sourced_](/api/primitives/sourced) internal implementation

Before [_Sourced_](/api/primitives/sourced) fields internally were represented as [_Stores_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/store/) with a final value of a field, which value changes fast right before read. This scheme was based on [Effector's computation priority](https://effector.dev/en/explanation/computation-priority/) and served well for a long time. But it had a few drawbacks:

- It could be easily broken by minor changes in Effector itself. And we plan such changes in the future major releases of Effector (e.g. [experimental phasing](https://github.com/effector/effector/pull/958), [batching improvements](https://github.com/effector/effector/pull/922), [`combine` improvements](https://github.com/effector/effector/pull/916), etc.);
- It led to race-conditions in some cases (e.g. [simultaneously started _Query_ created by `attachOperation`](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/issues/327)).

After v0.9 [_Sourced_](/api/primitives/sourced) fields internally is represented as [_Stores_](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/store/) with a function return final value of a field. It is more stable and less error-prone.

If you use `normalizeSourced` or `combineSourced` in your code, you may need to update it to the new API. Examples can be found in [the PR](https://github.com/igorkamyshev/farfetched/pull/354). Since `normalizeSourced` and `combineSourced` are low-level undocumented functions, we do not provide a migration guide for them.
